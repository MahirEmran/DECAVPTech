1. While doing a cost-benefit analysis, Janae found it quite difficult to measure certain items in dollar amounts. Such costs or benefits are most likely to be __________ costs or benefits. 
A. opportunity
B. one-time
C. intangible
D. hidden

1. C
Intangible. A cost or benefit that is difficult to measure in dollar amounts is referred to as an intangible. Intangibles include costs and benefits such as increased or decreased employee morale, increased or decreased customer goodwill, etc. One-time costs are expenses the business pays only once when implementing a decision or project. Opportunity costs refer to what a business will lose if it chooses to spend resources on one decision or project rather than another. A cost-benefit analysis does not include “hidden” costs.

2. Which of the following is a benefit of establishing incident reporting procedures in the workplace: 
A. Employees use their judgment to determine if a report should be issued.
B. Managers who create these procedures are not required to follow up on incidents.
C. Managers who have information about incidents can investigate possible causes.
D. Employees cannot file official complaints if an incident is reported correctly.

2. C
Managers who have information about incidents can investigate possible causes. Establishing procedures for reporting workplace incidents is very important to promoting workplace safety. These procedures should allow for efficient communication of incidents that occur and provide management with the information they need to investigate the factors that led to the incident occurring. Therefore, reporting processes can lead to a decrease in workplace incidents. Incident reporting procedures should provide guidance about what types of incidents need to be reported, taking the decision out of the hands of employees. Although employees can still file complaints about workplace incidents, those incidents that resulted in timely, detailed reports can help clear up any issues about whether or not the company has created a dangerous work environment. Managers should always follow up on incidents that occur in the workplace.

D. delegating them.

3. B
Understanding them. For project managers, the most important part of managing stakeholder expectations is understanding them. Only when project teams feel they fully comprehend what stakeholders expect can they start to manage those expectations. It would not make sense to compete against stakeholder expectations or delegate them. Stakeholders would be the ones justifying their expectations, not project managers.

D. transition period.

4. D
Transition period. Transition periods are designed to allow you to adjust to your new surroundings over time. By adjusting slowly to his new job duties, Nilesh was less likely to feel overwhelmed. Resource issues occur when you don't have enough of a resource (people, money, information, ideas, and other essential items that are used to produce or do something). Government regulations deal with laws. Emergencies include situations like fires or floods that demand quick action and adaptation by everyone involved.

Identifying the potential hazards. A risk assessment is a careful assessment of what could cause harm within an organization, along with determining whether the organization is doing enough to prevent those risks. The first step in a risk assessment is identifying the potential hazards.

6. A primary advantage for marketers who use direct mail to promote products is that 
A. most marketers find that it is more effective than micro-marketing methods.
B. it is usually less expensive than personal selling methods.
C. it is more effective in creating brand awareness than television advertising.
D. marketers can deliver their messages to a broad audience.

6. B
It is usually less expensive than personal selling methods. Direct mail is defined as promotional messages that are sent directly to consumers' homes and businesses. Direct mail appears in many forms, including postal mail (e.g., catalogs, sales letters) and email. Personal selling is a form of promotion that determines client needs and wants and responds through planned, personalized communication that influences purchase decisions and enhances future business opportunities. Although developing direct-mail pieces can be expensive, personal selling is generally considered the most expensive promotional method. Micro-marketing is a general term that is sometimes used to describe target marketing. Direct mail (e.g., junk mail, spam) is not necessarily more effective in creating brand awareness than television advertising. Direct mail is used more often with targeted markets, rather than broad audiences.

7. Kyra is a business owner who wants to calculate individual employee productivity. She knows that last month, her team of four workers generated $10,000 worth of goods by working 200 hours in an office space measuring 1,000 square feet. What is the labor productivity per employee for the whole month? 
A. $40,000
B. $12.50
C. $800
D. $2,500

7. D
$2,500. Labor productivity is calculated by dividing total output by total input. To calculate the productivity of each employee, divide the output by the number of workers, which equals $2,500 for the whole month ($10,000 / 4 = $2,500). The number of hours worked is not relevant unless you wish to calculate the labor productivity per hour. The size of a workspace is not relevant to labor productivity calculations.

A. Mass media advertising and sales promotions
B. Referrals and sales promotions
C. Getting retailers to stock the product and creating a supply chain
D. Customer relationship management and trade shows

8. D
Customer relationship management and trade shows. Customer relationship management is a pull strategy, while trade shows are a push strategy. Push strategies involve promoting products to intermediaries, who then promote the products to customers. Pull strategies involve promoting products directly to the ultimate consumer or industrial user; intermediaries then purchase the products from the manufacturer to meet customer demand. Mass media advertising and sales promotions are both pull strategies. Getting retailers to stock the product and creating a supply chain are both push strategies. Referrals and sales promotions are both pull strategies.

A. Using a "give-and-take" tactic to reach an agreement
B. Giving the other person as much time as they need to decide
C. Pushing the other person into making a decision
D. Insisting on your terms during the negotiation process

9. A
Using a "give-and-take" tactic to reach an agreement. This tactic is known as bargaining, and it can be a highly effective negotiation strategy. Each person proposes solutions and uses "give-and-take" tactics to reach an agreement. You may have to give up something, but you get something in return. During negotiations, you should give the salesperson a specific deadline to meet your request. It's a way of making the negotiation real and specific. An advantage to this strategy is that it introduces a deadline as a negotiable point. If you set a deadline earlier than is necessary, you can build in negotiating room. Similarly, if you show no flexibility whatsoever during a negotiation, the other person may decide that it's not worth their time to speak with you.

10. Determine the cost of goods sold for a business when the beginning inventory was $250,000, purchases were $600,000, and the ending inventory was $200,000. 
A. $1,050,000
B. $650,000
C. $400,000
D. $150,000

10. B
$650,000. To determine the cost of goods sold, the beginning inventory and purchases are added together to obtain the goods available for sale. The ending inventory is then subtracted from that amount to obtain the cost of goods sold. In this problem, $250,000 (beginning inventory) + $600,000 (purchases) = $850,000 (goods available for sale) - $200,000 (ending inventory) = $650,000 (cost of goods sold).

D. increases the business's financial security in an unpredictable environment.

11. A
Provides guidelines for personnel to meet the company's objectives. A marketing plan is a set of procedures or strategies designed to attract target customers to a business. A comprehensive marketing plan identifies the specific actions and activities that a company will use to attract its target customers. Therefore, the marketing plan provides guidance for employees who are carrying out the marketing activities. Because internal and external factors change, a marketing plan does not reduce the need for a business to develop corrective action or contingency plans, nor does it increase its financial security. Marketing plans contain both short-term and long-term goals.

A. operating expense.
B. expense control.

D. budget deficit.

12. C
Capital expenditure. A capital expenditure is a one-time purchase that a business makes (e.g., land, building, equipment) that will provide long-term benefits in the future. In this case, the veterinarian's addition of a surgical wing will help grow their practice and ultimately result in more opportunity for profit. Operating expenses are the ongoing, day-to-day costs involved in running a business that are not tied to production. A budget deficit occurs when expenditures exceed revenues, which we have no proof of in this scenario. Expense control includes efforts to maintain or reduce a certain level of spending.

13. One way that a business can learn about its competitors' activities is by 
A. developing product specifications.
B. reviewing secondary data.
C. identifying communication barriers.
D. evaluating intranet efficiencies.

13. B
Reviewing secondary data. By learning about its competitors' markets, products, pricing, and promotional activities, a business can determine its competitors' strengths and weaknesses in the marketplace. By evaluating its competitors' strengths and weaknesses, a business can determine the ways in which it can gain market share. To obtain information about its competitors, the business can collect secondary data, which are information that has been collected for purposes other than the project at hand. Secondary information that the business might review includes its competitors' promotional materials, their products, and industry publications. An intranet is a business's internal computer network. Because a business does not have direct access to its competitors' intranet systems, it would be difficult for a business to obtain specific information about the ways in which its competitors' intranet systems work. Developing product standards will not provide a business with information about a competitor's activities. Communication barriers are problems that interfere with the effective exchange of information.

Goals and objectives. A common way to assess the performance of a business plan is to develop and use key performance indicators. Key performance indicators are an effective way to track, measure, and improve business results. Aligning key performance indicators with business goals and objectives can help an organization stay focused on the aspects of the business that are most important to it. Key performance indicators are not necessarily aligned with a business's operating expenses, corporate culture, or payroll and benefits.

A. Require employees to sign non-disclosure agreements.
B. Acquire patents and copyright registrations for intellectual property.
C. Pay contingency fees to ensure lawyers are available when needed.
D. Require employees to maintain records of key knowledge.

15. A
Require employees to sign non-disclosure agreements. Requiring employees to sign non-disclosure agreements can help prevent former employees from sharing confidential knowledge with competitors. Requiring employees to maintain records of key knowledge does nothing to prevent them from sharing it. Patents and copyright registrations can protect formal product designs and proprietary information, but they do not provide the legal incentive to prevent former employees from sharing confidential information. Maintaining access to legal services does not help prevent former employees from sharing information.

20. Which of the following decreases as production increases in a business that has economies of scale: 
A. Income taxes
B. Pay rates
C. Net profits
D. Fixed costs

20. D
Fixed costs. Economies of scale are characteristics that allow a business to increase output without experiencing a comparable increase in the cost of production. The fixed costs of production are spread over more units so the overall cost of producing more and more products actually decreases. For example, once an electric plant is built, the cost of producing electricity decreases because the cost of building the facility is spread over more and more units of electricity. In a business that has economies of scale, net profits may increase, which will lead to an increase in income tax. Pay rates usually do not decrease as a result of economies of scale.

Regulatory and environmental factors that affect process design include government regulations and the political or social environment surrounding a company. Technological factors include the cost of necessary equipment or technology.

34. Which of the following is a product consideration when selecting distribution channel members: 
A. Perishability
B. Promotion
C. Intensity
D. Segmentation

34. A
Perishability. A product's characteristics often influence how it moves through the distribution channel. Because a highly perishable product (e.g., fruit, milk) has a short life cycle, it should quickly move through as few channels as possible so it remains fresh for purchase and consumption. Promotion and segmentation are market factors. Intensity is a distribution strategy.

A. why it should evaluate work schedules.
B. how to increase its efficiency.
C. how to detect a problem.

A. Industry standards
B. Payroll reviewed by leaders
C. Usernames and passwords
D. Segregation of duties

37. A
Industry standards. External controls are influences from outside a company that impact how it functions. They ensure that companies are accountable for their actions and uphold a certain standard of behavior. External control mechanisms include industry standards, government laws and regulations, union contracts, external audits, and media relations. Payroll reviewed by leaders, segregation of duties, and usernames and passwords are all internal control mechanisms. Internal controls are rules and procedures implemented by a company to manage its operations and create consistent outcomes. Internal controls are used by a company to ensure integrity, prevent fraud, and promote accountability.

Starbucks and American Eagle Outfitters. Indirect competition is a rivalry between or among businesses that offer dissimilar goods or services. Starbucks offers coffee and other specialty drinks, while American Eagle Outfitters sells clothing. The businesses offer different products but are competing for consumers' scarce dollars, making them indirect competitors. On the other hand, direct competition is a rivalry between or among businesses that offer similar types of goods or services. For example, Apple and Microsoft sell computers, software, and other electronics; McDonald's and Burger King sell fast food; and AT&T and Verizon sell cell phone services.

39. A
Cross-functional. To remain competitive in the marketplace, businesses often develop systematic, ongoing processes to help them recognize opportunities to fulfill a market's unmet needs and wants. Cross-functional work teams consist of a variety of people who have different skills and experiences, and who often work in different company departments. Group diversity provides different perspectives, which often sparks creativity to identify product opportunities. Homogenous, production, and independent-matrix are not terms normally used to describe a product-development work team.

Segregation of duties. Segregation of duties is a concept that refers to more than one person completing a task. Segregating duties helps companies avoid errors and misconduct that could be committed by one individual. Companies that institute segregation of duties are strengthening their corporate governance structures.

A. You don't have to pay back the money if the business fails.
B. You have control over how the money is spent.
C. You have help from knowledgeable, experienced investors.
D. You don't need to pay interest on the money.

41. B
You have control over how the money is spent. One of the biggest benefits of debt financing is the ability to control how the financing is spent. When you take out a business loan, you are in control of what you do with the money. When you obtain equity financing, however, the investors that are helping you start your business have primary control over business decisions. Some of the downsides of debt financing include interest payments and the need to pay the money back even if the business fails. Help from experienced investors is a benefit of equity financing, not debt financing.

D. will generate regular income for them after the purchase.

43. A
Creates value for potential buyers. A business owner who plans to sell their company should develop products, employees, and business strategies that will appeal to future buyers. When a business owner sells their business to another company, they typically give up control and no longer earn personal income from it. Developing a business to appeal to one specific company is an ill-advised business strategy because it severely limits the number of potential buyers.

Consistent experiences. A brand promise is a business's agreement (spoken or unspoken) with customers that it will consistently meet their expectations and deliver on its brand characteristics and values. All messages and touchpoints should reinforce the brand promise in a consistent way. Brand characteristics vary among businesses and products but may focus on product quality. Businesses use many touchpoints to communicate their brand promises—employees, website, advertising, public relations activities, etc. All of the touchpoints and messages form the customers' impressions of the business and influence their experiences with the business.

46. How does a business's gross profit compare to the industry standard of 25% if it has annual sales of $500,000 and cost of goods sold is $400,000? 
A. 5% lower
B. 10% lower
C. 5% higher
D. 10% higher

46. A
5% lower. Businesses often compare their income from sales and the cost of buying those goods to the industry standard in order to determine if they are spending too much based on the profit earned. If the industry standard is 25% gross profit, a business wants to make sure that it is earning that amount. To calculate the percentage of gross profit, first subtract the cost of goods sold from annual sales to determine gross profit ($500,000 $400,000 = $100,000). Then, divide that figure by annual sales ($100,000 ÷ $500,000 = .20). Convert that figure to a percentage by multiplying by 100 (.20 X 100 = 20%). In this case, the business is earning 20% gross profit which is 5% lower than the industry standard.

A. are less likely to act unethically.
B. understand the company's inner workings.
C. provide an objective perspective.

48. C
Provide an objective perspective. An organization's board of directors should include both inside and independent members. Inside members are high-level executives, shareholders, or stakeholders in the organization. Independent members are not involved with the organization. They provide an objective view, keep the board transparent, and help balance out the power of the board. They do not represent the interests of management. They also do not necessarily understand the company's inner workings, at least not as well as inside members. Independent members are not necessarily any less likely to act unethically than inside members.

Reducing risk. To be successful innovators, businesses need to reduce risk. Innovation is always risky, but by evaluating the potential market for their innovations and basing new innovations on previous experiences, businesses can decrease risk. It's also extremely important for a business to make sure it has enough money and resources to handle launching its innovation.

C. current liabilities.
D. current assets.

51. D
Current assets. A balance sheet is a financial statement that captures the financial condition of the business at that particular moment. Inventory and accounts receivable are categorized as current or short-term assets because the levels of inventory and income from sales tend to fluctuate. Owner's equity is the amount an owner has invested in the business plus or minus profits and losses. Long-term assets are items of value that businesses use to generate revenue for more than a year (e.g., buildings, vehicles, and capital equipment). Current liabilities are debts that must be paid within a year.

A. When credit standing is high
B. When interest rates are low
C. When available cash is limited
D. When mortgage money is plentiful

When available cash is limited. Many new businesses have limited amounts of cash available to cover the costs of purchasing property, which usually include a down payment, closing costs, taxes, etc. On the other hand, the initial cash expense for leasing is often limited to a security deposit and the first rent payment. When cash is limited, it is usually more economical for businesses to lease rather than to buy a facility because it saves them money. If businesses have sufficient cash, it is more economical in the long run for them to buy rather than to lease, especially when interest rates are low, their credit standing is high, and mortgage money is plentiful.

Comprehensive. Enterprise risk management is a top-down business activity that involves planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures used by management to limit company losses. This approach considers risk management from the perspective of the entire, comprehensive organization rather than by distinct business units. Therefore, words like “segmented” are not accurate descriptions of enterprise risk management. Risk management assesses potential hazards but is not necessarily hazardous. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of other people, which is not necessarily a component of enterprise risk management.

A. It increases the likelihood that you will succeed.
B. It makes your goal more challenging and time-consuming.
C. It encourages communication throughout the process.

66. A
It increases the likelihood that you will succeed. The more often you monitor progress while working toward a goal, the more likely you will be to achieve it. Monitoring goal progress keeps you accountable and aware of where you are. Monitoring progress does not necessarily add external pressure to accomplish tasks, encourage communication, or make a goal more challenging and time-consuming.

67. Macon Industries writes a purchase order for bolts, washers, and nails and sends the order to the Stanton Company to process. In this situation, the purchase order is a(n) 
A. letter of intent.
B. open order.
C. accounts-receivable document.
D. sales contract.

67. D
Sales contract. A purchase order is a form that a business fills out to order goods. Because the order indicates that the business is willing to do something (pay for the items it orders) in exchange for something else (take possession of the goods), the purchase order serves as a sales contract. An open order is a type of purchase order in which buyers place the order with the supplier that can best meet the needs or criteria (e.g., price) for a particular item. Because accounts receivable is an accounting activity that involves collecting payment for the goods and services that the business offers, a purchase order is not an accounts-receivable document. A letter of intent is a letter that declares the writer's intention to do something. A purchase order is a form rather than a letter.

A. strategic relationship.
B. distribution channel.
C. contingency plan.
D. communications plan.

69. A
Strategic relationship. A strategic relationship is one in which multiple businesses enter into an agreement and help each other, financially or otherwise. Often, the partnering businesses have assets or services that may help the other. A communications plan is a document that contains strategies for managing the flow of information that must occur between all of a project's stakeholders throughout the life of the project. A contingency plan is a set of specific guidelines to help respond to undesirable circumstances. A distribution channel is a path or route that goods or services take from the producer to the ultimate consumer or industrial user. Although every business must have at least one distribution channel, sharing a warehouse facility as a means to save money is not an example of a distribution channel.

B. economic trends can help you identify opportunities.
C. work experience can lead to new business ventures.
D. entrepreneurs should focus on completely new industries.

71. C
Work experience can lead to new business ventures. One way that entrepreneurs determine opportunities for new business ventures is through their own work experience. Delia's work experience as a server, for example, helped her determine an opportunity to automate payments in the restaurant industry. This example is not related to economic trends. It is not true that entrepreneurs should focus on completely new industries; many entrepreneurial ventures take place within existing industries, such as in Delia's case.

C. Delay taking action so that the connection between the infraction and the penalty becomes blurred.
D. Resume a normal attitude toward the employee as quickly as possible.

74. D
Resume a normal attitude toward the employee as quickly as possible. While the supervisor may find this difficult to do, it is important because expecting further problems with the employee may actually cause them to occur. The immediate supervisor should handle disciplinary action, particularly minor problems. Action should be taken promptly so that the connection between the infraction and the penalty does not become blurred. Remedial action should be taken in private, without coworkers present so that the employee's dignity and their status in the organization can be preserved.

Management by objectives. The employee and the supervisor work together to set goals, or objectives, for the employee to meet during a certain time period. The employee is then evaluated on the basis of how well they met the goals. Rank-order technique ranks all employees in a department or division from best to worst. Affirmative action is an effort to create equality in the workplace through hiring, training, and promoting of members of groups that have been subjected to discrimination. Positive reinforcement is a technique in which people are given approval or rewarded for good performance.

Important considerations in establishing hardware/software specifications include user needs, capabilities, ease of use, compatibility, mobility, technical support, security, performance, cost, licensing, reliability, upgrades/updates, and training. While delivery terms, social media policies, and strategic planning may be considered at some point in establishing specifications or selecting specific hardware/software, they are not significant considerations in establishing hardware/software specifications.

80. Hotel chains carefully analyze economic conditions and the competition before raising prices because the product the chains provide has 
A. limited supply.
B. elastic demand.
C. unlimited supply.
D. inelastic demand.

80. B
Elastic demand. Elastic demand is a form of demand in which changes in price correspond to changes in demand. Even a small change in price affects demand for the product. As a result, hotel chains carefully analyze economic conditions and the competition to make sure a price increase will not reduce demand. If customers feel the new price is too high, they will not buy because hotel rooms are products that customers do not need in order to survive. There is not an unlimited supply of hotels which means the supply is limited; however, they are plentiful so customers usually will be able to find one in the right price range. Inelastic demand is a form of demand in which changes in price do not affect demand.

D. determine the steps that employees need to follow to complete the project.

82. D
Determine the steps that employees need to follow to complete the project. Business process thinking is a method of thinking that emphasizes the importance of processes in business. Managers who use business process thinking would most likely focus on establishing the process that employees should follow before beginning a new project. While the end result is important in any project, managers who use business process thinking would place more emphasis on the process than the result when beginning a new project. They would not create a list of things employees should avoid doing during the project. Examining the financial implications of a project is important but does not describe business process thinking.

Purchase books to fulfill requested orders. A small brick-and-mortar bookstore is more likely to benefit from purchasing books to fulfill requested orders from customers. A small store will not benefit from storing large quantities of books due to limited space and the high cost of carrying extra inventory.

A. are not loyal to popular brands.
B. demand high-quality goods.

D. desire the same level of service.

92. C
Have different needs and wants. Successful businesses understand that it is often easier and more cost effective to develop strategies that appeal to a portion of the market rather than the whole market. This is because consumers are unique and have different needs and wants. For example, some consumers want highquality goods and services, while others are less concerned with quality and want low prices. By dividing the market into segments, a business can determine which segments are more likely to buy its products. Then, the business can develop a plan of action to target the market that has similar needs and wants. The business's goal is to develop a loyal customer following and create brand insistence by appealing to the market that is most likely to purchase its products.

Payroll expenses. A small-business owner considers many factors when determining if they should hire an employee. Payroll tends to be the largest expense for a business, so the small-business owner must determine how much or if they can afford to pay an employee. Payroll expenses include the employee's salary, taxes, health and disability insurance, benefits, etc. After the small-business owner decides to hire additional staff, they can determine the appropriate interview techniques and training methods to use. Product standards are a product management consideration rather than a staffing consideration.
