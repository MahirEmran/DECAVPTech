1. What can result from employees not respecting one another's lifestyles? 
A. Generational misunderstandings
B. An uncomfortable work environment
C. Language barriers
D. An increase in productivity

1. B
An uncomfortable work environment. Sometimes, employees do not respect each other's lifestyles and discriminate against each other because of them. When this occurs, employees might experience an uncomfortable work environment. This can damage productivity. Language barriers are a result of ethnic or cultural differences rather than differences in lifestyles. Generational misunderstandings are not a result of disrespecting lifestyle choices.

2. What is often the best way for a business to increase its profit? 
A. Lower taxes
B. Raise prices
C. Reduce expenses
D. Improve sales

2. C
Reduce expenses. Decreasing expenses is perhaps the best way that businesses can help increase profit. Businesses have control over many of their expenses and can take measures to reduce them. For example, they can eliminate some free services and encourage workers to turn off lights and equipment when not being used, in order to save money on energy costs. Raising prices will not increase profits unless customers are willing to pay the higher prices. Tax rates are regulated by government. If businesses improve sales, they might increase their profits if the rate of sales is proportionately higher than the expense involved.

3. To achieve a good work-life balance, you should always 
A. budget your time and energy.
B. do activities you enjoy.
C. set high personal goals.
D. complete work tasks first.

3. A
Budget your time and energy. The best way to achieve work-life balance is to budget your time and energy. Being aware of your own limits can help you avoid overcommitting to outside responsibilities or taking on too many projects at work. Always completing work tasks first can cause your personal life to suffer. Regularly doing activities you enjoy can cause you to neglect work responsibilities. When setting goals, it is important to create balanced ones that consider both your career and your personal life.

A. They look for ways to increase their productivity.
B. They often fail to follow directions.
C. They overuse their sick leave and other benefits.
D. They come to work late and leave early.

5. A
They look for ways to increase their productivity. Responsible employees look for ways to do jobs faster so that they will be more efficient. This increases their productivity and makes their output cost less than the output of irresponsible employees who don't care about productivity. Irresponsible employees cost the business money by coming to work late and leaving early, failing to follow directions, and overusing their benefits.

Your level of self-esteem can fluctuate from time to time; however, if you have an overall high level of self-esteem, you can accept yourself as you are—both your positive and negative qualities. Having good self-esteem does not mean that you overlook your faults, weaknesses and mistakes; rather, you recognize them and strive to improve over time. A person with high self-esteem has the ability to recognize others' abilities and accomplishments without feeling threatened or discouraged about their own abilities and accomplishments. Many people who have low self-esteem do not trust their own abilities and are less likely to try harder or strive for success because they fear they will fail.

Blanket purchase orders are created when the item and negotiated price are set with a supplier or vendor, but the quantity and schedule may vary from order to order. These are most often used for recurring orders of the same item in circumstances where the item quantity is likely to vary based on need. Often there is a negotiated set of terms and conditions including spending limits and duration of agreed pricing. A standard purchase order is used for a single purchase in which the terms and conditions apply only to a single transaction. A planned purchase order is often used in situations with recurring purchases in which the item, price, quantity, and delivery schedule are all negotiated and set. A contract purchase order is a formal agreement between buyer and supplier in which terms are set but no actual purchase is required. Contract purchase orders act like contracts for future purchases but do not necessarily require any purchases to be made.

Many situations can prevent individuals from reaching their financial goals. When people lose their jobs or need to get their cars fixed, their financial goals may be temporarily sidetracked. Overuse of credit cards can also affect an individual's ability to achieve their financial goals. An individual who must pay off credit card debt has less money available to save and invest. In Max's situation, impulsive spending derailed his financial goals. He saw something that he wanted right away, so he bought it without thinking about the consequences. It will likely take Max longer to reach his savings goal. A video game is considered a want, not a need, so unexpected needs did not hinder Max from reaching his goal.

B Concentrating on remembering what the speaker says. One technique people use to improve listening skills is to make a conscious effort to try to focus and remember what the speaker says. Staying focused on the message and filtering out noise as much as possible improves the chances of remembering and accurately understanding the message. Listeners may want to be aware of their own body language (e.g., facial expressions, crossed arms) because their nonverbal cues are also being interpreted by the speaker and can affect communication. However, monitoring one's own nonverbal cues does not necessarily mean that the listener takes control of the conversation. Thinking about how to respond to messages while the speaker is talking is a barrier to active listening. To decipher a message accurately, the listener must not only pay attention to the speaker's words but also to their nonverbal cues and voice tone. Nonverbal cues are not necessarily more important than tone of voice.

In general, businesses should try to honor all special needs and specific requests of customers. However, if the request jeopardizes the safety of others (e.g., leaving a security checkpoint unattended), it might be impossible to honor that request. Requests should be honored even if the customer is impolite and demanding. Businesses should honor requests that are unrelated to health. Finally, whether or not a customer is new to the company is unrelated to whether or not their request should be honored.

Psychographic segmentation is based on the lifestyles and personalities of customers. Because Alex demonstrated an interest in a travel show, marketers can deduce that traveling is a part of his lifestyle. Thus, Alex would be an appropriate market for a tropical resort. Behavioral segmentation occurs when customers are grouped based on what they are looking for in a product and why they buy the product. Demographic segmentation divides the market on the basis of physical and social characteristics. Geographic segmentation groups customers based on where they are located.

60. D Observing, questioning, listening. The best way to determine customer needs is to learn more about the customer. Observing includes nonverbal communication that the salesperson can use to better know their customer. Questioning lets the salesperson ask what the customer needs through different types of questions (yes/no, clarifying, open-ended, etc.). Listening is crucial, because if the salesperson asks a question and doesn't listen to the response, the question is useless. Presenting, visualizing, and follow-up usually occur after a customer's needs have been determined. Greeting, modifying, and focusing, as well as canvassing, qualifying, and organizing will not provide as much information about the customer as observing, questioning, and listening.

If multiple records for one customer exist, each record may have incomplete or differing information. Having multiple records for one customer in a database can cause confusion for employees and may cause the business to ship goods or send bills to an incorrect address. When a business detects more than one record for a customer, it should place all of the most current information in one record and delete the other record(s) to prevent employees from accessing the wrong record in the future. Reformatting the other or second record, creating a new record, and reorganizing all of the customer records are not actions that prevent a business from having multiple records for one customer in its database.

After this, the transactions can be journalized and posted to ledgers. When the books have been balanced, the business can prepare financial statements.

79. A Price. Price is the marketing element requiring marketers to determine the amount of money they will ask in exchange for their products. In the travel and tourism industry, price is closely associated with customers' perceptions of value and worth. If customers think the travel product has value and worth, they are often willing to pay for it. Also, value and worth differ from customer to customer, so what is value to one customer might not be value to another. For example, some people prefer economy hotels because saving money is a value to them. To other people, receiving many services is a value that they are willing to pay for. Profit is the monetary reward a business owner receives for taking the risk involved in investing in a business. Place is the marketing element focusing on considerations in getting a selected product in the right place at the right time.

Investing. Using money to make money is called investing. Saving is setting aside part of your current income for future use. Rationing is a function of relative prices that determines who gets the goods and services produced—it is determining how scarce resources will be distributed. Reimbursing involves paying back or refunding money that someone has spent.

7. When preparing the property's marketing plan, Samantha researched the current, popular travel destinations; the ways in which visitors spend their money; the duration of their vacations; and their demographics. These are examples of __________ trends. 
A. industry
B. technology
C. visitor
D. competitive

7. C
Visitor. Visitor trends are studied so that the property can predict the number of upcoming reservations and bookings it is likely to receive based on such things as people's ages, incomes, marital status, and travel habits. Competitive trends identify the directions that other properties are moving, including their price adjustments, renovation plans, levels of service, and so forth. Trends in technology provide information about how computers, the internet, and new equipment are likely to change the way properties operate. Industry trends give an idea as to the impact that other businesses are likely to have on the property, especially those (e.g., airlines, convention centers, and highway departments) in which the property depends upon for their success.

8. Successful brands use brand promises to connect with their customers on a(n) __________ level. 
A. rational
B. ethical
C. logical
D. emotional

8. D
Emotional. A brand promise is the specific benefit that customers can expect from using the good/service and interacting with the company. It connects to customers on an emotional level and gives meaning to the brand. Successful brands use brand promises to connect to their customers on a "gut" level. Customers are more likely to be loyal to brands that they feel share their values and beliefs. Some customers may feel connected to a brand due to its ethics, but brand promises do not always connect with customers on an ethical level as they do an emotional one. Customers might choose to purchase products and services from companies due to rational or logical reasons, but these are not usually connected to the business's brand promise.

9. Which of the following is an example of a value-added promotion offered by a hotel: 
A. Daily housekeeping
B. Hotel airport shuttle
C. Indoor swimming pool
D. Discounted rooms

9. B
Hotel airport shuttle. Value-added hotel promotions are typically complimentary “add-on” services or products that give customers an additional incentive to book a room. Many guests value an airport shuttle that provides convenience and reduces transportation costs. Daily housekeeping is a basic service that is typically included with any hotel room. An indoor swimming pool is a built-in hotel amenity. Discounting rooms is a promotional technique that does not provide anything additional to guests.

A. purchasing habits.
B. buying motives.
C. annual incomes.
D. personal attitudes.

10. A
Purchasing habits. An invoice is the formal, printed record of a sale that includes all necessary information of a sales transaction. The information includes the buyer, the seller, items purchased, quantities, prices, delivery date, credit, discount terms, etc. Because invoices record detailed information about sales transactions, businesses can review their invoices to analyze their customers' buying habits. By reviewing invoices, a business can determine the best-selling products and the products that are not moving, which helps the business make decisions about its product mix. Invoices do not reveal information about customers' personal attitudes, annual incomes, or buying motives.

12. To protect customer data such as credit card information, businesses should 
A. keep sensitive records encrypted.
B. use a shared server to store information.
C. require that all customers show an ID.
D. accept payments in cash only.

12. A
Keep sensitive records encrypted. Encrypting sensitive data such as credit card information, phone numbers, and addresses can prevent security breaches that can lead to information theft. Accepting payments in cash only may prevent security breaches but would most likely hurt a business' sales. Requiring customers to show a form of identification would not prevent sensitive information from being leaked or stolen. Businesses should use their own dedicated server for storing sensitive data. Using a shared server is a risk because other people or companies may have access to the information stored on it.

B. All levels of needs are important and can be satisfied simultaneously.
C. Most people are able to satisfy only lower level needs.
D. Lower level needs must be satisfied before higher level needs can become important.

13. D
Lower level needs must be satisfied before higher level needs can become important. The five levels of needs, from lowest to highest levels, are physical, safety, social, self-esteem, and self-fulfillment. The theory states that the lower level needs must be relatively well-satisfied before higher level needs can become important to us. The theory does not support the statement that most people can satisfy only lower level needs.

14. From a legal standpoint, hospitality and tourism customers have the right to expect businesses in this industry to take 
A. reasonable care.
B. no risks.
C. total responsibility for accidents.
D. insurance out of each customer.

14. A
Reasonable care. When hospitality and tourism businesses act in a way that a reasonable hospitality and tourism business would have acted, the business exhibits reasonable care. If hospitality and tourism businesses can prove that they acted with reasonable care, they are not fined by the courts. Otherwise, the courts can find them guilty of negligence, and they would be charged a fine. It's not possible for hospitality and tourism businesses to avoid all risks. There is always the chance that something bad can happen. Hospitality and tourism businesses are not insurers of their customers nor do they take out insurance on each customer. Instead, they take out liability insurance that transfers risk to an insurance company. Hospitality and tourism businesses act so that they limit their responsibility for accidents.

Column. A column chart shows the differences in individual values vertically. It is useful to show the difference between values in different time periods, such as the rising sales of Alaskan cruises over time. Pie charts show the proportion of each segment to the whole. They are not useful for showing rising sales over time. A scatter chart is used when showing relationships and correlations between variables, rather than rising sales over time. A histogram is used to show frequency distribution, not rising sales over time.

A. ask his parents if they will pay for his new apartment.
B. quit his job so that he has more time to plan.
C. apply for a personal loan from a bank.
D. consider how the move will affect his budget.

16. D
Consider how the move will affect his budget. Before making any financial decision, you should carefully consider the potential consequences. In Aiden's case, he should consider how moving to an apartment and paying rent will impact his personal budget. Only after careful consideration and planning should he make a decision. He shouldn't ask his parents to pay for his apartment, since that would be inappropriate. Moving to an apartment generally symbolizes the start of a young person's adult life, and most adults pay for their own living arrangements. It would be unwise for Aiden to quit his job if he is considering moving out, since he will need the income to pay for rent. Aiden shouldn't apply for any loans before deciding if he will be moving.

C. Implementing a frequent-buyers program for the business's customers
D. Allowing customers the ability to opt-out of the email updates that the business provides

19. A
Selling customer lists without the customers' consent to third parties. It is unethical for a business to sell its customers' information to third parties without the customers' permission because it is a breach of privacy. When privacy is breached, trust is broken, and customers may defect to the business's competitors. Implementing a frequent-buyers program, collecting information with authorization, and allowing customers to opt-out of email updates are ethical actions.

Small businesses represent a large majority of international trade. Freight forwarding services are often used by companies, but they are not required.

B. Low self-esteem usually motivates a person to try harder and strive for success.
C. Your level of self-esteem depends on your ability to accept yourself as you are.
D. To have high self-esteem, you must be willing to overlook your faults and weaknesses.

21. C
Your level of self-esteem depends on your ability to accept yourself as you are. Self-esteem is how you feel about yourself at any given time. Your level of self-esteem can fluctuate from time to time; however, if you have an overall high level of self-esteem, you can accept yourself as you are—both your positive and negative qualities. Having good self-esteem does not mean that you overlook your faults, weaknesses and mistakes; rather, you recognize them and strive to improve over time. A person with high self-esteem has the ability to recognize others' abilities and accomplishments without feeling threatened or discouraged about their own abilities and accomplishments. Many people who have low self-esteem do not trust their own abilities and are less likely to try harder or strive for success because they fear they will fail.

23. C
Transportation. The development of rail, automobile, and air travel in the past 150 years has had the most impact on the development of the hospitality industry. Business and leisure travel has dramatically expanded because the time, comfort, and ease of travel has improved. This, in turn, creates a demand for facilities to house a wide variety of travelers. The retail, lumber, and financial industries would be impacted by growth or decline of the hospitality industry. The higher demand for hospitality services would naturally result in a higher demand for financial backing, building materials for facilities, and retail establishments for travelers.

B. Data that show which month has the highest number of customers using the loyalty card
C. Data that reveal which customers use their loyalty cards the most often
D. Data that show the number of times each customer has used the card over several months

26. D
Data that show the number of times each customer has used the card over several months. The mean of a set of data is the average of those data. So, the most effective method for determining the mean use-rate of loyalty cards involves using data from a wide range of customers. Examining several months of individual customer data will help determine the mean or average use-rate of customers' loyalty cards. Data revealing the month of highest loyalty card use do not show the overall customer use-rate. Data revealing which customers use the card most or least also do not help determine the overall customer use-rate.

A. Contract purchase order
B. Blanket purchase order
C. Standard purchase order
D. Planned purchase order

28. B
Blanket purchase order. Blanket purchase orders are created when the item and negotiated price are set with a supplier or vendor, but the quantity and schedule may vary from order to order. These are most often used for recurring orders of the same item in circumstances where the item quantity is likely to vary based on need. Often there is a negotiated set of terms and conditions including spending limits and duration of agreed pricing. A standard purchase order is used for a single purchase in which the terms and conditions apply only to a single transaction. A planned purchase order is often used in situations with recurring purchases in which the item, price, quantity, and delivery schedule are all negotiated and set. A contract purchase order is a formal agreement between buyer and supplier in which terms are set but no actual purchase is required. Contract purchase orders act like contracts for future purchases but do not necessarily require any purchases to be made.

33. Max set a financial goal of saving $2,000 in the next year. On a whim, Max saw a new video game that he wanted, so instead of putting a portion of his paycheck in his savings account, he used that money to purchase the game. What barrier is preventing Max from reaching his goal? 
A. Impulsive spending
B. Overuse of credit
C. Unexpected needs
D. Loss of income

33. A
Impulsive spending. Many situations can prevent individuals from reaching their financial goals. When people lose their jobs or need to get their cars fixed, their financial goals may be temporarily sidetracked. Overuse of credit cards can also affect an individual's ability to achieve their financial goals. An individual who must pay off credit card debt has less money available to save and invest. In Max's situation, impulsive spending derailed his financial goals. He saw something that he wanted right away, so he bought it without thinking about the consequences. It will likely take Max longer to reach his savings goal. A video game is considered a want, not a need, so unexpected needs did not hinder Max from reaching his goal. Max did not lose income; he simply chose to spend his earnings impulsively.

Cash reconciliation. Cash reconciliation is the process of verifying the amount of cash in a register at the end of a business day. It allows businesses to keep track of cash flow. The manager of a restaurant should perform cash reconciliation before closing the restaurant down for the night. Bank reconciliation, internal audits, and financial ratio analysis are not completed on a nightly basis.

A. they won't meet their goals as quickly.
B. they can't trust their subordinates.
C. their followers won't do a good job.

38. D
Most goals can't be reached alone. Sharing the power means recognizing that most goals cannot be reached alone and engaging followers in meaningful work. Sharing the power does not mean that a leader doesn't trust their subordinates, doesn't think that their followers will do a good job, or that they won't meet goals as quickly.

39. Trent took notes in a meeting, but when he looked over them later, he realized that he was missing some important information. To determine what he failed to write down, Trent should 
A. use a consistent, logical note-taking format.
B. ask a coworker to help him fill in the blanks.
C. condense what he has written to be more concise.
D. tackle the tasks he was assigned at the meeting.

39. B
Ask a coworker to help him fill in the blanks. It can be difficult to capture everything important when taking notes. If Trent realizes that his meeting notes are incomplete, he should ask a coworker who was also in the meeting to help him fill in what he is missing. While it's a good idea to tackle assigned tasks after a meeting, this will not necessarily help Trent deal with the missing information in his notes. Using a consistent, logical notetaking format is an effective strategy, but it will not help Trent after the fact when he is missing important information. Condensing what he has written to be more concise will not help Trent fill in the missing information.

41. What is typically the first step in the managerial planning process? 
A. Developing company goals and objectives
B. Identifying necessary tasks
C. Establishing methods to evaluate progress
D. Prioritizing projects and tasks

41. A
Developing company goals and objectives. The first step in the managerial planning process involves establishing company goals and objectives. After establishing these goals, managers can identify the tasks and resources (money and staff) needed to reach those goals and objectives. Managers should then prioritize their goals and associated tasks so that staff understand where to focus their time and energy. Finally, managers should develop and implement methods to evaluate progress toward organizational goals and objectives.

42. What is one way someone can improve their active listening skills? 
A. Thinking about how to respond to the speaker's message
B. Concentrating on remembering what the speaker says
C. Paying more attention to the speaker's nonverbal cues than to their tone of voice
D. Controlling the conversation by monitoring their own nonverbal language

42. B
Concentrating on remembering what the speaker says. One technique people use to improve listening skills is to make a conscious effort to try to focus and remember what the speaker says. Staying focused on the message and filtering out noise as much as possible improves the chances of remembering and accurately understanding the message. Listeners may want to be aware of their own body language (e.g., facial expressions, crossed arms) because their nonverbal cues are also being interpreted by the speaker and can affect communication. However, monitoring one's own nonverbal cues does not necessarily mean that the listener takes control of the conversation. Thinking about how to respond to messages while the speaker is talking is a barrier to active listening. To decipher a message accurately, the listener must not only pay attention to the speaker's words but also to their nonverbal cues and voice tone. Nonverbal cues are not necessarily more important than tone of voice.

43. A passenger is upset with Petra, a flight attendant, because the plane has not taken off and they are worried about being late for an important meeting. Before responding, Petra takes a deep breath, listens to the passenger's complaint, and apologizes. Petra is 
A. diffusing the customer's anger.
B. solving the problem.
C. avoiding the conflict completely.
D. deferring to authority.

43. A
Diffusing the customer's anger. In the hospitality and tourism industry, it is important to know how to resolve conflicts with customers who are unhappy with the service. One of the first steps is diffusing anger because it is difficult to resolve conflict when one or more parties is angry. Petra is diffusing anger by remaining calm, listening, and expressing sympathy. In this example, Petra is not solving the problem, deferring to authority, or avoiding the conflict completely.

A. elastic.
B. competitive.
C. constant.
D. inelastic.

45. A
Elastic. Elastic demand is a form of demand for products in which changes in price correspond to changes in demand. Demand is inelastic when a change in price does not significantly affect demand. Inelastic demand exists if the demand for a product is constant, or ongoing. Demand is not described as competitive, but it is affected by competition. Products are more likely to have elastic demand if competitive products are available for consumers to purchase.

46. What might result if an event promoter scheduled a major concert in a facility that consumers considered to be located in an unsafe area? 
A. Decreased parking
B. Shortened hours
C. Reduced sales
D. Limited access

46. C
Reduced sales. The location of a sports or entertainment facility often has an effect on sales. If consumers feel that a facility is located in an unsafe area, they may be reluctant to purchase tickets to events. This would result in reduced sales. Event promoters should be aware of consumers' concerns for safety and schedule events in appropriate facilities. The location of a facility does not necessarily limit access or decrease parking. The length of an event would not be shortened because of the facility's location.

47. Sunny Side Up Cafe is a small, family-owned business in a quiet part of town. The restaurant does not accept credit cards—only cash. Which of the following is the most likely reason for the restaurant to refuse credit cards: 
A. Residents never carry credit cards.
B. The town restricts use of credit cards.
C. The business owners are old.
D. Credit cards have high processing fees.

47. D
Credit cards have high processing fees. When businesses accept credit cards, they are required to give some of the money from each sale they make to several third parties—such as the card provider, the banks that are involved, and various credit card associations. These processing fees can sometimes make accepting credit cards too expensive for small businesses that sell inexpensive items like breakfast foods. It is unlikely that the cafe decided to refuse credit cards because the owners are old, because residents never carry credit cards, or due to town restrictions.

48. One way that a business might try to compensate for the limited number of qualified workers is to increase its use of 
A. specialization.
B. conservation.
C. production.
D. automation.

48. D
Automation. Automation is the use of robots or other automatic equipment to do certain tasks. A business might make up for the shortage of qualified workers by relying more on the use of automated equipment or machinery. For example, the use of automatic phone systems often eliminates the need for a business to hire experienced phone operators. Production is the process or activity of producing goods and services. Specialization is the process of making the best use of resources in the production of goods and services. Conservation is the preservation and protection of resources and usually refers to natural resources rather than human resources.

49. Which of the following is a characteristic of the hospitality and tourism industry: 
A. Nonperishable
B. Intangible
C. Separable
D. Employee-centric

49. B
Intangible. The products offered by the hospitality and tourism industry are services and experiences—not concrete goods. Instead of receiving tangible items for their money, the buyer receives a trip, hotel stay, or experience that they hope will be pleasant and memorable. The services offered by the hospitality and tourism industry are perishable, meaning that they cannot be stored for later sale or use. Just as fresh produce cannot be kept forever, a cruise vacation or hotel stay must be consumed or used relatively soon after it is purchased. The hospitality and tourism industry is guest- and service-centric, rather than employee-centric. The hospitality and tourism industry is also inseparable, meaning that the services provided cannot be separated from their providers.

50. What technique can help businesses reduce risks associated with software piracy and unauthorized peer-topeer file sharing via the internet? 
A. Virtualization
B. Multicasting
C. Encryption
D. Rerouting

50. C
Encryption. Software piracy and unauthorized file sharing (e.g., of music) are costly to producers. To protect their ownership rights, these businesses often use encryption techniques to minimize these types of issues. Encryption is the process of transforming information into a secret code so that only the recipient can read it. If the recipient tries to pass along the information to others, the others will not be able to access the information. Virtualization involves running multiple operating systems on one machine. Multicasting transmits streaming media to multiple users simultaneously. Rerouting means changing course or direction.

A. Implement business policies
B. Update customer data
C. Review compliance requirements
D. Maintain intranet security

54. C
Review compliance requirements. Risk is the possibility of loss. Many internal and external factors affect the business's level of risk. Because risk affects the business's financial well-being, it must take steps to minimize risk. The government implements regulations, which are external factors that affect the business. It is important for the business to understand and keep up with the regulations that affect the way the business operates. If the business fails to comply with the regulations, it could be subject to penalties and fines, which can be very costly to the business. Updating customer data, maintaining intranet security, and implementing business policies are ways that the business controls its internal risks.

So that the information is readily accessible when it is needed. Companies should make inventories of their digital information so that it can be easily accessed when it is needed and so that no important data are lost. It is not necessarily true that employees don't use their computers wisely. Most employees use their computers appropriately and responsibly. Companies do not make inventories of their information to prevent IT professionals from stealing company data or to keep tabs on what employees are doing online.

56. A
Customers with reservations spend 25% more than other customers. Understanding the relationship between making reservations and spending can help a restaurant focus its sales and promotional efforts on dinner reservations in order to increase sales. Since the tipping of waitstaff, split plates, and payment methods do not increase sales, these data are less helpful.

A. If the request is unrelated to the customer's health
B. If the request jeopardizes the safety of others
C. If the customer is new to the company

57. B
If the request jeopardizes the safety of others. In general, businesses should try to honor all special needs and specific requests of customers. However, if the request jeopardizes the safety of others (e.g., leaving a security checkpoint unattended), it might be impossible to honor that request. Requests should be honored even if the customer is impolite and demanding. Businesses should honor requests that are unrelated to health. Finally, whether or not a customer is new to the company is unrelated to whether or not their request should be honored.

Psychographic. Psychographic segmentation is based on the lifestyles and personalities of customers. Because Alex demonstrated an interest in a travel show, marketers can deduce that traveling is a part of his lifestyle. Thus, Alex would be an appropriate market for a tropical resort. Behavioral segmentation occurs when customers are grouped based on what they are looking for in a product and why they buy the product. Demographic segmentation divides the market on the basis of physical and social characteristics. Geographic segmentation groups customers based on where they are located.

60. Good salespeople in the hospitality and tourism industry commonly use three techniques to determine customer/guest needs. What are those three techniques? 
A. Canvassing, qualifying, organizing
B. Presenting, visualizing, following up
C. Greeting, modifying, focusing
D. Observing, questioning, listening

60. D
Observing, questioning, listening. The best way to determine customer needs is to learn more about the customer. Observing includes nonverbal communication that the salesperson can use to better know their customer. Questioning lets the salesperson ask what the customer needs through different types of questions (yes/no, clarifying, open-ended, etc.). Listening is crucial, because if the salesperson asks a question and doesn't listen to the response, the question is useless. Presenting, visualizing, and follow-up usually occur after a customer's needs have been determined. Greeting, modifying, and focusing, as well as canvassing, qualifying, and organizing will not provide as much information about the customer as observing, questioning, and listening.

Purchasing relies on sales forecasts, which are predictions of future sales over a specific period of time, to buy the right amount of goods. Pricing policies are guidelines regulating the range of prices for goods and services that businesses offer to customers. Information about production needs is provided by the production department. Information about operating expenses is provided by the finance department.

A. Commercialization
B. Positioning
C. Test marketing
D. Licensing

71. B
Positioning. Positioning is a strategy in which a business creates a certain image or impression of a product in the minds of consumers. By creating and promoting special entrees using local produce, the restaurant is positioning itself as supportive of the local farming community. Test marketing involves introducing the product to a limited market to see how it will be accepted. Licensing means buying permission from another person or company to sell a product. Commercialization is the point at which the product goes into full-scale production, a marketing plan is put in place, service and sales training are conducted, and the product's life cycle begins.

72. B
Footers. A footer is a line of text appearing at the bottom of a presentation slide. A presenter may choose to include the name and date of their presentation in the footer to remind viewers of the focus of the presentation. Slide numbers are also often included in footers for the presenter's and viewers' reference. A header is a line of text or other data that appears at the top of a presentation slide or word processing document. The bibliography slide contains links and sources relevant to the presentation and does not typically have the name or date. Animations are movements added to objects (e.g., text, images) on presentation slides. Transitions are animations added to slides. Transitions dictate how one slide is removed from the screen and replaced with another. The presentation name and date are not typically included in animations or transitions.

Place. Place utility is usefulness created by making sure that goods or services are available at the place where they are needed or wanted by consumers. People at the beach would expect to find beach products at the store. Time utility is usefulness created when products are made available at the time they are needed or wanted by consumers. Possession utility is usefulness created when ownership of a product is transferred from the seller to the user. Form utility is usefulness created by altering or changing the form or shape of a good to make it more useful to the consumer.

A. the history of branding in those countries.
B. brand licensing laws.
C. co-branding practices in those countries.
D. foreign customs, values, and languages.

74. D
Foreign customs, values, and languages. Launching a brand in other countries requires knowledge, understanding, and sensitivity toward foreign cultures and taboos. Frequently, what is acceptable in one culture is not in another. Product names, promotional approaches, and sometimes even product features themselves may have to be adapted to make them acceptable—and saleable—to foreign customers. The history of brands in foreign countries may provide helpful context but is not a central issue in launching a brand internationally. Understanding brand licensing laws and co-branding practices in foreign countries may provide some helpful context, but are not central issues in launching a brand internationally, unless you one day plan to enter into a specific brand licensing or co-branding arrangement.

A. delete the other record.
B. reorganize all of the customer records.
C. reformat the second record.
D. create a new record.

76. A
Delete the other record. Customer records contain contact, billing, and purchasing information. If multiple records for one customer exist, each record may have incomplete or differing information. Having multiple records for one customer in a database can cause confusion for employees and may cause the business to ship goods or send bills to an incorrect address. When a business detects more than one record for a customer, it should place all of the most current information in one record and delete the other record(s) to prevent employees from accessing the wrong record in the future. Reformatting the other or second record, creating a new record, and reorganizing all of the customer records are not actions that prevent a business from having multiple records for one customer in its database.

77. C
Jiffy Parcel Service strives to provide the quickest, most reliable delivery service in the country. Organizational vision refers to the future a company's leaders desire to create. To achieve this vision, Jiffy's leaders and its employees must take specific actions (e.g., set goals, develop efficient processes). Management must communicate the organizational vision to employees so they understand their roles and perform their duties in ways that work toward achieving the organizational vision. Techno-Electronics set a specific sales goal. A project leader who tells their team that it is the most efficient project team in the firm is using positive reinforcement to maintain or boost morale. Departmental members working together to lower business costs are exhibiting teamwork.

78. C
Analyzing financial transactions. The first step in the accounting cycle is to analyze financial transactions. The accounting process begins with the collection of source documents for the business's financial transactions, which can include sales, purchases, or returns. After collecting this documentation, the business analyzes each transaction, determines the transaction amount, and identifies the accounts that the transaction affects. After this, the transactions can be journalized and posted to ledgers. When the books have been balanced, the business can prepare financial statements.

79. In the travel and tourism industry, customers' perceptions of value and worth are often associated with 
A. price.
B. promotion.
C. place.
D. profit.

79. A
Price. Price is the marketing element requiring marketers to determine the amount of money they will ask in exchange for their products. In the travel and tourism industry, price is closely associated with customers' perceptions of value and worth. If customers think the travel product has value and worth, they are often willing to pay for it. Also, value and worth differ from customer to customer, so what is value to one customer might not be value to another. For example, some people prefer economy hotels because saving money is a value to them. To other people, receiving many services is a value that they are willing to pay for. Profit is the monetary reward a business owner receives for taking the risk involved in investing in a business. Place is the marketing element focusing on considerations in getting a selected product in the right place at the right time. Promotion is a marketing function needed to communicate information about goods, services, images, and ideas to achieve a desired outcome.

A. Install electronic sensing systems
B. Hire professional security guards
C. Use closed-circuit television monitors
D. Provide employees with specialized training

80. D
Provide employees with specialized training. Businesses can help prevent computer fraud by making sure employees understand how to operate their hardware and software and how to use and protect their own identification codes or passwords. Employees also should be trained not to allow unauthorized individuals to see the computer screen, and to exit a confidential file or turn off the computer if they need to leave their terminals. Using closed-circuit television monitors, hiring professional security guards, and installing electronic sensing systems are ways of preventing shoplifting rather than computer fraud.

81. Iseabail conducts email marketing for a luxury spa, and she wants to know how many email campaign recipients read the most recent email. Which metric would most likely give Iseabail the information she is looking for? 
A. Click-to-open rate
B. Bounce rate
C. Open rate
D. Unsubscribe rate

81. C
Open rate. The open rate of an email campaign is the percentage of campaign recipients who opened an email. The click-to-open rate is the percentage of email viewers (those who opened an email) who clicked on a link. An email's bounce rate represents the number of emails that bounced, or could not be delivered. An unsubscribe rate represents the number of campaign recipients who opted out of receiving more emails. Because Iseabail wants to know how many recipients opened and read the most recent email, and is not yet concerned with clicks, she needs the campaign's open rate.

85. The Elegance Pointe resort is twice as busy from March through August, so it often hires seasonal employees to help meet demand. What is one way for the resort to encourage its seasonal employees to provide highquality service? 
A. Enforce a strict termination policy for bad service
B. Expand full-time roles to take on more responsibility
C. Seek out recruiting opportunities such as college job fairs
D. Offer training and professional development

85. D
Offer training and professional development. Seasonal employees are usually either new or have not worked in several months, so their customer service skills might be out of practice. The Elegance Pointe resort should train these employees well, as well as offer professional development opportunities so employees can offer excellent service. Seeking out recruiting pools such as college job fairs and expanding full-time roles to take on more responsibility are good ways to handle peaks in demand, but they are not necessarily related to improving seasonal employees' customer service skills. Enforcing a strict termination policy for bad service will not necessarily encourage the employees to provide high-quality service; rather, it might create a culture of fear.

C. Send a memo to the human resources manager
D. Question an employee from another department

86. A
Ask the department manager about the policy. If employees are not sure if they can or should work overtime, they should ask their department managers. Generally, department managers can authorize overtime for their subordinates. Departmental policies are not usually posted on the company's website. Overtime policies often vary by department, so asking an employee who works in another department is not an appropriate action to take. If the department manager is unavailable, the employee might ask the human resources manager about overtime policies.

A. a corporate merger.
B. a joint venture.
C. a product extension.
D. product positioning.

88. C
A product extension. A product extension is an additional product related to, but different than, the main product. In the example, Fun-Tastic's primary product is a form of entertainment—an amusement park with rides and shows. A water park is also a form of entertainment, but differs from an amusement park because it involves water and swimming activities. A merger occurs when two individual businesses combine to form one organization. Product positioning refers to the consumer's image or impression of a product as compared to that of competitive products. A joint venture is an arrangement that involves two or more businesses entering into a relationship by combining complementary resources such as technology, skills, capital, or distribution channels for the benefit of all parties. A joint-venture relationship is usually short-term or for a single project/transaction.

90. C
His company's intranet. An intranet is an internal network similar to the internet that is accessible only by authorized personnel. It is used to access information and communicate with others within an organization. A company intranet often consists of internal databases, which provide computerized storage for information and facts. Businesses typically maintain information in their databases that are relevant to their operations—product specifications, inventory levels, vendor contact information, customer sales records, etc. When an employee needs information, such as the model number of a customer's printer, they can quickly obtain the customer's sales records by accessing data stored on the intranet, which will ensure that the employee orders the correct printer cartridge for their customer. The manufacturer's accounting department, its production manager, and the company's contact directory are unlikely to have the information needed.

A. To appeal to the target market
B. To justify the price
C. To develop appropriate advertising
D. To analyze market research

91. A
To appeal to the target market. Core values represent the underlying worth of products and the image those products project. Products have value beyond price, and these values often are more important to customers than the price. For example, the core values of one product might include quality construction and a respected reputation. These are the values that appeal to the target market and encourage the target market to buy the products. A business does not communicate the core values of its products to justify the price, develop appropriate advertising, or analyze market research.

92. B
A cafe develops a logo illustrating its core value of using natural ingredients. Branding refers to tactics that establish and promote the identity and unique values of a company and distinguish it from other businesses. Illustrating the use of natural ingredients helps communicate a core business value that distinguishes the cafe from others. Advertising products and selling tickets for special events are examples of a business using promotion. Printing a company logo on disposable paper products helps identify a company, but it does not necessarily help promote its unique values.

Accurate interpretations. Businesses obtain a variety of information that must be analyzed to make it useful. While manipulating the data for information analysis, businesses should try to interpret them accurately to obtain information that will answer specific marketing questions. Many times, businesses can manipulate the data to obtain the answers they want. This practice will not help them solve problems or make good decisions if they interpret the data inaccurately. Exploratory research is a method of obtaining information. Secondary information is information that has already been collected for another purpose.

A. Eliminate the project
B. Lower expectations
C. Cut costs
D. Decrease time

100. C
Cut costs. In some cases, the amount of money you think you will need will not be possible to obtain. When this happens, the most realistic approach is to look for ways to cut costs. If your ideal budget is based on getting everything you want or would like to have, consider substituting inexpensive materials for costly ones or making do without some supplies. By cutting costs, you will be able to proceed with the project. It is not necessary to lower your expectations because, in most cases, you will be able to complete the project by making some substitutions. Decreasing the amount of time that is allotted for the project will not necessarily make up for a lack of funding. Eliminating the project is not a good choice, either.
