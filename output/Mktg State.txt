1. When a business presents an item to the marketplace by emphasizing its economic value, the business is positioning the product on the basis of its 
A. features.
B. price.
C. competitors.
D. benefits.

1. B
Price. Product positioning is the customer's image or impression of a product as compared to that of competitive products. For example, the Ford Focus (automobile) is positioned to emphasize the car's ability to provide customers with a mode of transportation at a relatively low price. Benefits are the advantages that the customer receives from using the product. Features are the product's attributes or characteristics. A business competitor is a rival business that seeks to attract the same scarce customer dollars. Some businesses position their products to compete with similar products offered by other (rival) businesses.

2. Which of the following sample designs is similar to “drawing names out of a hat”: 
A. Simple random sampling
B. Systematic random sampling
C. Stratified random sampling
D. Cluster sampling

2. A
Simple random sampling. Simple random sampling is a probability sampling method in which every sampling unit has a known and equal chance of being selected--akin to drawing names out of a hat. Stratified random sampling is a probability sampling method in which researchers break the target population down into nonoverlapping groups and draw simple random samples from each one. Cluster sampling is a probability sampling method in which researchers divide the target population into non-overlapping sub-populations that are determined by geography and then randomly sample each one. Systematic random sampling is a probability sampling method in which researchers place sampling units into a random list and draw a sample using a skip interval.

Secondary data. The sales invoices are examples of secondary data, or facts, figures, and statistics that already exist and have been used for purposes other than the marketing research study. Primary data are new facts, figures, or statistics gathered for the specific marketing research project being conducted. Relevant variables are the types of information studied in a marketing research project (e.g., brand awareness, customer satisfaction). Units of analysis are the entities or elements that are being studied in market research (e.g., individual, household).

A. Promotion
B. Place
C. Product
D. Price

6. B
Place. The place, or distribution, element of marketing involves moving, storing, locating, and/or transferring ownership of goods and services. Making products available where customers are willing to go is also a concern of place. Price involves determining and adjusting prices to maximize return and meet customers' perceptions of value. Product refers to what goods, services, or ideas will be offered to customers. Promotion refers to the various strategies that marketers use to communicate information about goods, services, images, and/or ideas to achieve a desired outcome.

A. bar codes and PLUs
B. outsourcing and EDI
C. PLUs and invoices
D. bar codes and EDI

7. D
Bar codes and EDI. Bar codes are a way of marking products that allows for electronic data interchange (EDI). This is an example of integrated information sharing that has advanced most areas of physical distribution. Merchandise information stored on the magnetic bar code is used for pricing, inventory control, reordering, market research, etc. PLUs or price look-ups are codes assigned to merchandise that typically changes price frequently. The number is entered into the checkout system and the assigned price ID rung. Outsourcing requires an outside business to complete a specified task.

A. It asks respondents to assess two different topics at the same time.
B. It influences the respondent's answer by inserting an opinion.
C. It uses unfamiliar terminology that could confuse respondents.
D. It is an open-ended question that limits the respondent's answer.

8. A
It asks respondents to assess two different topics at the same time. The survey question "How would you rate our customer service and product quality?" is an example of a double-barreled question, which requests a single answer for two different topics (customer service and product quality). It is not an open-ended question limiting the respondent's answer. The survey question does not insert an opinion or use unfamiliar terminology.

Operating expenses. Operating expenses are the costs of running a business. They may be variable or fixed but do not include the costs of items purchased for resale, or the cost of goods sold. Fixed costs are business costs that are not affected by changes in sales volume. An example is rent. Variable costs are business costs that change according to changes in sales volume. An example would be increased salary expense due to the hiring of more salespeople.

10. You are a marketing-research specialist for a company and have been asked to develop ideas for a new product that the company might produce. To compile age, income, and geographic information on possible customers, you should obtain 
A. primary data from marketing-research companies.
B. primary data from industry organizations.
C. secondary data from government agencies.
D. secondary data from company sales records.

10. C
Secondary data from government agencies. Secondary data are information that have been collected for purposes other than the project at hand. Government agencies are a good source of secondary data because they compile extensive information on the general public, including median age and income statistics in geographic areas throughout the country. Company sales records would not contain age, income, and geographic information on customers. Information from marketing-research companies and industry organizations is considered to be secondary data rather than primary data.

A. employee
B. operating
C. purchasing
D. selling

11. D
Selling. Selling policies are general rules established by management to guide the personal selling effort and outline how things must be done. Salespeople may encounter problems when they are not knowledgeable about their company's selling policies and are unable to explain them to potential customers. Salespeople may risk losing a sale if they are unable to explain policies about issues such as credit terms and delivery service. Operating policies regulate the actual running of a business. Employee policies are guidelines explaining how employees are to act and how they are to deal with customers. Purchasing policies are guidelines that direct purchasing decisions.

12. When Aaron receives what looks like an email from his bank asking him to verify his account information, he replies with his account number, phone number, and social security number. However, Aaron soon finds out that the email wasn't from his bank at all—it was from a scammer. Aaron is the victim of 
A. a computer virus.
B. a break-in.
C. phishing.
D. key logging.

12. C
Phishing. Phishing occurs when an email that appears to be from a reputable source (like your bank, a store, a credit card company, or an online auction site) is actually from a scam artist. The email might ask for personal information like account numbers, which the scammer is likely to use to access the victim's funds. Key loggers record your keystrokes, enabling someone to record your passwords and account numbers as you type them. Aaron is not the victim of key logging, a break-in, or a computer virus.

A. change their personal opinions.
B. be willing to share information.
C. possess the same skills and attitudes.

Be willing to share information. Collaboration involves working together in a cooperative manner. It requires honesty, trust, and a willingness to share information to accomplish common goals. It is not necessary for people to possess the same skills and attitudes or to change their values or opinions to effectively collaborate. An overly competitive attitude may hinder collaboration because people may become more interested in their own agendas rather than focusing on the group's goals.

A. Additional paperwork such as references and cover letters are required at job interviews.
B. Appearance is critical in the workplace.
C. Researching a workplace before the interview is crucial.
D. Personal appearance does not always reflect a person's attitude.

16. B
Appearance is critical in the workplace. Employers often judge potential employees based on first impressions. You can expect an interviewer to examine your personal appearance carefully and to interpret it as an indicator of the way you might perform on the job. Researching a workplace and bringing appropriate paperwork to the interview are important but may not be significant if a negative first impression is given. Personal appearance does not always reflect a person's attitude, but one must assume that the appearance of your clothing will help determine whether the interview would be a waste of the employer's time.

A. So that it can be used in multinational marketing
B. So that it can easily be changed over time
C. So that it gives the product a generic image
D. So that it sets the product apart from other products

17. D
So that it sets the product apart from other products. The brand name should not be too common or too similar to those used by competitors. It should be appropriate and even clever, if possible. A brand name's adaptability makes it useable in multinational marketing and prevents it from needing to be changed over time. A distinctive brand name gives the product a specific image, not a generic image.

18. A business might have an excess of goods available for sale if it fails to gather marketing information and makes decisions using the __________ approach to marketing. 
A. low-priced
B. short-term
C. best-guess
D. data-based

18. C
Best-guess. The information gathered through the marketing-information management function enables business owners and managers to make informed decisions about what to sell and to whom to sell, rather than relying on a "best-guess" approach to marketing. Without the data from marketing-information management, businesspeople can only guess at what and how much to offer for sale. An incorrect guess could leave businesses with excess goods that no one wants to buy. The low-priced approach involves selling goods at low prices. The short-term approach involves making decisions to solve immediate problems. The data-based approach involves relying on research and information to make decisions.

19. The Power Good Company is attempting to project how much profit its brand new product is likely to generate. What is the company doing? 
A. Generating facts
B. Making estimates
C. Building data sets
D. Making predictions

19. B
Making estimates. Estimates are approximations of data--or put more simply, educated guesses. Since the product is brand new, the company doesn't have any past sales on which to base its projection. Instead, it has to formulate its best guess for how much profit the product will generate. A prediction is based on past sales and current market data. Facts are data that can be verified. Because the product is new, there is no way data can be verified for it. Data sets may be the foundation for estimates or predictions, but there's no indication that the business in this situation is building data sets.

A. obedience to authority.
B. loss aversion.
C. incrementalism.
D. sunk costs.

20. D
Sunk costs. Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred and thus cannot be recovered. If you have already invested in something, it is difficult to admit that it was not the right decision, especially when there is nothing you can do about it. Loss aversion is the tendency to avoid a loss at all costs, even when attempting to avoid that loss can lead to negative consequences. Obedience to authority refers to the natural tendency to want to please authority figures. Incrementalism refers to the diminishing of ethical values over time.

After her supervisor ends the call, ask her to clarify the instructions. It is always best to get clarification straight from the source of the information. Most supervisors will appreciate an employee who knows how to collect facts and then do a job well instead of an employee who guesses and then wastes time completing the wrong thing. Asking a coworker may lead to an incorrect guess as well. Proceeding without clarification may lead to time and effort wasted. Working on something else means that Tonia ignored her supervisor's wishes for the tasks to be done today.

25. A
Shifts in population ethnicity. A product opportunity is a favorable circumstance that presents itself to provide a good or service that customers are willing to buy. Kwan discovered a product opportunity to sell Korean goods when a Korean plant built and relocated Korean workers in his community. Because the number of Korean residents increased, the community experienced changes or shifts in population ethnicity. Kwan's store is a way to meet the unfulfilled needs of a very specific market.

Providing training programs. Positive channel relationships require collaboration among channel members. Collaboration involves sharing relevant information, setting mutually beneficial goals, and developing a teamoriented attitude. Channel leaders have the most power or leverage in the channel, and can implement tactics to foster positive relationships. Providing channel members with product training programs helps channel members be successful in selling the products.

29. For legal purposes, what should a business do when it collects marketing information from its online customers? 
A. Post its privacy policies on its website
B. Store the information at an insecure site
C. Purchase surge-protection insurance
D. Develop confidential selling strategies

29. A
Post its privacy policies on its website. Privacy policies are a business's guidelines about how it maintains and uses its customers' information such as credit, purchasing habits, and addresses. To protect consumers' privacy, governments often legislate how businesses can obtain and use customer information. Jurisdiction refers to the authority (e.g., location, subject matter) a court has to resolve a legal issue. For example, one state, province, or country may require a business to disclose to customers that it allows third parties access to certain customer information, while another state, province, or country may not have the same law. Therefore, businesses should post their privacy policies on their websites to reduce the risk of lawsuits that may be initiated by customers in other jurisdictions. Storing information at an unsafe site is a poor business practice and may be grounds for a lawsuit in some jurisdictions. A surge protector is a device that individuals and businesses use to prevent excessive bursts of electricity from damaging computers. Some insurance companies provide businesses with insurance to cover losses associated with power surges. Selling strategies are the plans of action for the selling function, which do not always affect consumers' privacy.

30. B
Three-day cooling-off period. The Federal Trade Commission enforces a regulation that gives consumers a three-day cooling-off period after signing a purchase contract for consumer goods or services. Consumers cannot be penalized by the seller for canceling a contract within the three-day period. This protects consumers from their own hasty decisions or from high-pressure selling tactics that have influenced them. The Consumer Product Safety Commission requires businesses to list harmful ingredients. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration provides updates on motor vehicle safety.

C. Angela developed a written survey containing open-ended questions.
D. Tim did not answer the last two questions on a written survey.

32. D
Tim did not answer the last two questions on a written survey. Nonresponse errors occur when respondents do not answer a question or complete a survey. These errors may affect the quality of the overall data and the analysis process. Because Tim didn't answer two questions on a survey, a nonresponse error occurred. Errors may be intentional or unintentional. For example, a respondent might refuse to answer a question because they believe it is too personal, while another respondent might not answer a question because they did not see it. Incorrect coding is an editing error. When a sample group is not representative of the target market, a procedural error occurs. Developing open-ended survey questions does not indicate a nonresponse error.

35. Why are Universal Product Codes (UPCs) often preprinted on products before the manufacturer ships the products to the business? 
A. To simplify the price-marking function
B. To reduce the possibility of theft
C. To improve the transportation system
D. To increase the product turnover rate

35. A
To simplify the price-marking function. The Universal Product Code (UPC) label is encoded with product information such as price, brand, size, etc., to be read by an electronic scanner. Technology allows manufacturers to preprint this data on packages before shipping them to businesses. The preprinted data simplify the price-marking function because the business does not need to mark a price on each product. The UPC data contain the necessary pricing information. Preprinting UPCs on products does not increase the product turnover rate, reduce the possibility of theft, or improve the transportation system.

36. Warehousing and shipping methods are operations considerations related to 
A. expense control.
B. maintenance needs.
C. logistics.
D. scheduling.

36. C
Logistics. Operations are the day-to-day activities for continued business functioning. Logistics refers to the function of operations that manages the flow of goods and services from production to consumption. Logistics includes all the people, information, and processes involved in storing (e.g., type of warehouse) and transporting goods (e.g., shipping method). Scheduling is the production activity that establishes the timetable to be followed in production. Maintenance needs refer to the routine maintenance and repair of business facilities and equipment. The operations function controls many activities within the business, which means that this function encounters a lot of expenses incurred by the business. Therefore, expense control is an important operations activity because it focuses on efficiency and keeping the business's costs low for its day-to-day activities.

40. What are producers most likely to do if they decide their incomes are inadequate? 
A. Continue to buy more resources
B. Choose not to make goods and services
C. Continue to increase production
D. Choose not to supply needed resources

40. B
Choose not to make goods and services. Producers must receive enough income so that they are able to continue making or providing goods and services. If they decide that their incomes are inadequate, they may choose not to make goods and services, and production would cease. If their incomes are inadequate, producers probably would not buy more resources or continue to increase production. Resource owners, not producers, supply needed resources.

41. B
Obtaining and applying information about a customer's preferences and needs in ways that will build an ongoing buyer/seller relationship. Customer relationship management (CRM) is the strategies, processes, and policies used by businesses to build, maintain, and maximize the long-term value of customer relationships. To build a loyal relationship with a customer, a business must know a customer's needs, wants, and preferences and take steps to accommodate these needs, wants, and preferences on an ongoing, consistent basis. To maintain customer loyalty, a business must be able to effectively communicate with the customer in many ways--both personal and nonpersonal. Not all businesses can or want to customize their product mix; however, they can use technological applications to personalize the messages that they send to customers. Although a business might want to use CRM strategies to increase market share by appealing to new market segments, this does not always involve manipulating external data.

B. a direct-mail package can only be used once.
C. it cannot be used for soliciting repeat customers.
D. it can be expensive to produce and distribute.

44. D
It can be expensive to produce and distribute. Direct-mail is a promotional medium that comes to consumers' homes and businesses. Traditional direct-mail advertising involves the production and distribution of promotional materials that are delivered by a postal or delivery service to consumers' mailboxes. The high cost per piece means a business will need to calculate carefully the response rate needed to break even. It is ideal for getting repeat customers and can be timed for the mailings to arrive at crucial periods, such as the beginning of a sales promotion. In many situations, packages can be designed for reuse or to be reused with very little updating.

Maintain employee goodwill. Public relations efforts that are aimed at employees are often attempts to enhance employee morale and maintain employee goodwill toward the business. Educating the public about the company is the purpose of other types of public relations, such as those that are aimed at consumers. Taking advantage of employees is not usually a purpose of public relations.

47. Which of the following factors helps determine if a manufacturer is illegally using closed sales territories for distribution purposes: 
A. Limited risk
B. Reduced competition
C. Increased intensity
D. Perishable goods

47. B
Reduced competition. A distribution channel consists of all the businesses and individuals that move products from the producer to the end user. Governments develop laws to monitor and regulate distribution activities so that individuals and businesses operate in a consistent, fair manner. When a channel member attempts to reduce competition, it may be violating certain laws. One activity that may reduce competition is a manufacturer closing a sales territory to keep its competitors from obtaining access to the market. High distribution intensity, product type (e.g., perishable), and risk level are not factors that determine if a manufacturer is illegally using closed sales territories in relation to the distribution process.

To get a fair share of the market. Gaining market share is often an important pricing goal. Businesses may lower prices to attract new customers and increase their market share. This could create goodwill in the community, but that is not the purpose of the tactic. Price levels are not used to attract employees.

A. domestic subsidies.
B. trade agreements.
C. export limits.

Trade agreements. Global trade is an intricate balancing act. When one or more key players in the global economy begins reducing its participation in trade, the entire economy can suffer. To reduce the negative effects of import tariffs and other trade restrictions, countries often negotiate trade agreements with one another. Trade agreements attempt to strike deals among several countries to encourage cross-country trade. Domestic subsidies are often used as a form of trade protectionism, not as a method for encouraging global trade. Export limits and import restrictions would also fall into the category of trade protectionism.

D. determine the customers' buying intentions.

61. A
Update the company's customer records. When customers change phone numbers and email addresses, move, or go out of business, a company needs to update its customer database to reflect the changes. A company with outdated customer information is more likely to experience financial losses. For example, a company may not be able to collect payment on overdue accounts if it cannot reach its customers by phone to follow up. Also, a company's promotional mailings are likely to be returned if it does not have current mailing addresses for its customers. In this situation, the company has wasted money in postage.

To build customer confidence. Prospective customers pay attention to statements from experts in the field who are willing to recommend a product. They feel if the product satisfies the expert, it will satisfy them. The testimonial may not shorten the sales presentation, and that should not be the salesperson's intention. A testimonial ad cannot help predict what sales of a product will be or prove that it is a better buy than another product. Advertising campaigns do not necessarily guarantee the best buy.

65. C
Enables tracking of users' viewing and purchasing habits. Promotion is a term that refers to the various types of communications that marketers use to inform, persuade, or remind customers of their products. Technological advancements (e.g., internet) have made it possible for a business to track its customers' (visitors') behavior in relation to their website hits, inquiries, and purchases. The ability to track this online information often helps the business to determine its customers' needs and preferences, and to determine the best way to meet these needs and preferences. Because other factors influence a business's success, using the internet to promote products does not always increase annual sales volume or create a loyal customer base. Using the internet as one method of promotion does not necessarily mean that a business should reduce its traditional publicity efforts.

B. Brand positioning
C. Integrated marketing
D. Personal selling

66. A
Children's advertising. Children are often the target of advertising because they have significant buying power and also influence the buying decisions of many adults. Advertising to children frequently becomes an ethical issue for businesses because messages that are suitable for adults may not be suitable for children. Businesses must be cautious not to take advantage of children by giving them information or making claims that they will not understand. Businesses have an ethical obligation to be fair and truthful when advertising to children. Brand positioning involves creating a certain image or impression of a brand as compared to those of competitors' brands. Integrated marketing is not an ethical issue. Personal selling is the form of promotion that determines client needs and wants and responds through planned, personalized communication that influences purchase decisions and enhances future business opportunities.

69. Salespeople offer solutions to customers' needs by demonstrating their products and encouraging customers to __________ the products. 
A. handle
B. approve
C. admire
D. watch

69. A
Handle. Salespeople demonstrate products to show customers how the products will solve customers' problems or meet their needs. Salespeople try to appeal to customers' senses by getting the product into the customers' hands and showing them how it works. Handling a product makes customers feel a sense of ownership and encourages them to buy. Having customers handle the product is more likely to encourage customers to buy than letting them watch the salesperson handle the product. The final objective of any demonstration is not just to have the customer admire or approve of the product but to purchase it.

70. Abdul is in the market for an engagement ring. When he decides on the ring he would like to purchase, the salesperson informs him of the company's lifetime warranty on engagement rings. Abdul decides to opt in for the warranty and signs a written contract. This is an example of a(n) 
A. implied warranty.
B. express warranty.
C. strategy.
D. guarantee.

70. B
Express warranty. An express warranty is a warranty that is written or expressed verbally. Because the salesperson verbally informed Abdul of the lifetime warranty and he signed a written contract, this is an example of an express warranty. An implied warranty is an unwritten, unspoken warranty understood by the customer and the seller that the product will perform as expected. A guarantee (often called a money-back guarantee) is a promise made to the consumer that a product's purchase price will be refunded if that product is not satisfactory. A strategy is a plan of action for achieving goals and objectives.

71. B
A company asks customers to share product reviews on a website. Amplified word-of-mouth strategy involves a business asking others to help spread the word about its products, such as requesting customers to share product reviews on a website. Customers sharing the release date for a new product on Facebook, posting comments about a company on Instagram, and sharing their opinions of a new product with a friend are examples of organic word-of-mouth because they were created by consumers, not the company.

A. They have to be eliminated first.
B. They are not used in the calculations.
C. They are subtracted from the net worth subtotal.
D. They are subtracted from the total of assets.

73. D
They are subtracted from the total of assets. To determine personal net worth, a person's assets are first totaled, and then personal liabilities are subtracted. Net worth does not appear as a subtotal and cannot be determined before liabilities are subtracted. It is not necessary to eliminate liabilities before calculating personal net worth.

C. Contains loaded language
D. Makes the product appealing

74. D
Makes the product appealing. Persuasive messages usually are intended to encourage someone to do something. In the case of a sales message, the goal usually is to persuade a customer to buy a product. To do this, the message should make the product appealing to the customer so the customer will understand the benefit of buying and want to buy. The sales message should persuade the customer to spend money. Persuasive sales messages are not intended to simply remind the customer of the product or discredit the competition. Persuasive messages should not use loaded language, which is often biased and stereotypical.

A. Evaluating company feedback
B. Assessing company guidelines
C. Following company procedures
D. Developing company policies

75. C
Following company procedures. Policies are the general rules to be followed by company personnel. For example, a business owner may develop a policy that states the company will reimburse employees for certain business-related expenses. A procedure is the step-by-step process that personnel follow in performing a specific task. In the example, Luke was following certain steps to obtain reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses that he incurred--obtaining and completing the appropriate form, attaching receipts, and submitting the documentation to his manager.

76. What should employees do after interacting with each customer? 
A. Take a short rest break
B. Talk to the manager about the customer
C. Thank the customer for coming
D. Prepare a sales report

76. C
Thank the customer for coming. It is important to thank each customer for visiting or doing business with your company. Thanking customers makes them feel welcomed and appreciated, and they are more likely to work with your business in the future. Talking to a manager about the customer is likely unnecessary unless a question came up during your interaction with the customer. Preparing a sales report after interacting with each customer is inefficient and unnecessary. Sales reports are more likely to be prepared for an extended period of time such as a week, month, quarter, or year. Although rest breaks are important, it's not feasible to take a short break after every customer.

A. True; identifying the reason for the research is an easy and inexpensive step.
B. True; this step is easy because businesses know what their research needs are.
C. False; outside experts must be hired to identify the reason for the research.
D. False; identifying the real reason for the research can be a very difficult step.

77. D
False; identifying the real reason for the research can be a very difficult step. The reason that this is true is that the business cannot always identify a concern, situation, or problem accurately to determine what information it needs. While outside experts may be helpful in some cases, it is not always necessary to hire them. Usually, personnel within the business are in the best position to identify the reason why the business needs to use marketing research because of their familiarity with the business.

A. A business's core values identify the beliefs that the business stands for.
B. Brand cues are used primarily to identify the company in its advertising.
C. Customer service representatives are responsible for corporate branding.
D. Customer touch points typically occur before sales transactions.

78. A
A business's core values identify the beliefs that the business stands for. A corporate brand consists of all of the combined customer impressions and experiences associated with a particular company. Many different elements, including the company's core values, brand cues, brand personality, brand promise, and touch points, make up a corporate brand's identity. A business's core values, also known as its brand values, are the beliefs or qualities that a brand stands for and is built around. The first step of building a corporate brand involves defining the company's core values. Customer touch points, which are all the opportunities that businesses have to connect with customers and reinforce their brand values, occur before, during, and after sales transactions. Everyone in the company is responsible for corporate branding--not just the customer service representatives. Employees must understand and embrace the brand's values, personality, and promise for the corporate brand to take hold and be a success. Brand cues are elements that remind customers and employees of brands and their values. They appear throughout the workplace and community as well as in advertising.

79. A
Use white space. White space is blank space in a print advertisement that is unoccupied by text or illustrations. White space helps put focus on a specific aspect of an advertisement. Ollie could use white space to draw attention to one main feature in his ad. Changing fonts often is not necessarily a good design practice.

80. C
Stress. Worry and fatigue tense both physical and mental muscles. Stress blocks the flow of creative ideas. Limiting code of behavior is a pattern of behavior that limits creativity because people become convinced that a problem is unavoidable and don't look for solutions. People who need to be right the first time can't take the chance of being wrong. Creativity requires people to explore alternatives and to take risks. Creative people need to avoid limiting the number and quality of ideas by being critical.

B. offers special prices on a discontinued item.
C. misleads customers about the true value of a product.
D. sells products at a limited number of predetermined price points.

81. C
Misleads customers about the true value of a product. Deceptive pricing is an illegal pricing tactic because it misleads customers about the true value of a product. An example of deceptive pricing is setting a high price on a product and then advertising a big discount which actually reduces the price to a realistic, or normal, level. Customers buy the item because they think they are saving money when, in fact, they are paying what the item is actually worth. Price lining involves selling products at a limited number of predetermined price points. Variable pricing involves changing prices according to current demand. Promotional pricing involves offering special prices on certain products such as discontinued items. These pricing activities are not illegal.

Classified advertising. This type would be best to sell the display case because the ad can be put into an appropriate category, such as used business equipment. The ad would also be at a low cost, and no illustration is needed. Display advertising is more expensive because it uses one or more elements such as illustrations, headlines, variations in type and white space. Classified display advertising includes illustrations/special typeset in addition to the ad. Special advertising usually consists of notices such as public and legal notices.

Promotion. Promotion is a marketing function that communicates information about goods, services, images, and/or ideas to achieve a desired outcome. To successfully sell its product, a business needs to coordinate all the components of marketing, which include distribution, promotion, product, and price. For example, if a business develops an effective distribution system but fails to promote the product, customers will not know about the product or want it, although it is readily available. Operations is the business function that handles the day-to-day activities necessary to run the business. Production is the operations activity that involves the creation of goods and services from economic resources. Training is a human resources activity.

C. Less cooperation from the vendor
D. Better overall risk management

88. D
Better overall risk management. Most businesses depend on the continuous flow of supplies to survive; if this flow is interrupted because of issues with a vendor, problems for the company will follow. Evaluating vendor performance ensures that the vendor is reaching company expectations, and makes sure that the vendor is delivering quality supplies within the desired time frame. This reduces potential risks for the company. Evaluating vendor performance leads to fewer defects in the supply chain--not more. When a company evaluates its vendors, it increases the communication between company and vendor, usually leading to more cooperation from the vendor, not less.

A. Migration
B. Lifestyle
C. Consumption
D. Behavior

90. A
Migration. Migration is a population trend that indicates movement of people throughout the country as well as into and out of the country. Migration trends are important to businesses because businesses need to know where their customers are located. For example, many people are leaving colder climates and migrating to what is considered the Sunbelt. This movement affects businesses because the types of products they sell and the way they sell them will change. Also, the increased migration of ethnic groups into the country creates a need for new goods and services that meet the needs of a multicultural population. Lifestyle, consumption, and behavior are not population trends; however, these factors also affect how businesses market their goods and services.

A. Obsolescence
B. Introduction
C. Maturity
D. Decline

92. C
Maturity. During the maturity phase, sales peak and then slowly start to decline. Because there are more competitors that market similar products, a business uses advertising to remind customers about its goods and services. Businesses often make small changes to their products to make them appealing to the market's evolving needs and wants. This might involve adding new sizes or colors to the existing product line. During the decline phase, sales drop sharply, and businesses tend to reduce advertising. Obsolescence, which is the state of being outdated or unfashionable, occurs during the decline phase of the product's life cycle. At this point, businesses determine whether to continue to offer the product. Businesses communicate that their products are available during the introduction phase.

The technology of electronic funds transfer makes it possible for customers to pay invoices electronically so the cash is transferred from their bank account to the business's bank account. This eliminates the need for the business to handle checks, fill out deposit slips, and send the checks to the bank for processing. The cash is available immediately, and the business does not need to wait for a check to be processed before it can access the funds.

A. Packaging
B. Place
C. Promotion
D. Product
