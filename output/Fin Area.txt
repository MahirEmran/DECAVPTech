2. When the stock market rises, people are more confident and willing to spend, which leads to 
A. economic growth.
B. recession.
C. deflation.
D. fewer loans.

2. A
Economic growth. People generally view a rising stock market as a signal that the economy is strong. Therefore, they have confidence and are more likely to spend their money. This, in turn, causes the economy to grow. The rising of the stock market does not typically lead to recession, fewer loans, or deflation.

3. Jordan's business was highly successful last year. This year, he plans to introduce a new product line that he is certain will make his business even more profitable in the future. His financial advisor, Anna, has cautioned against taking such action because experts predict that the economy will enter a recession in the coming months. Even though Anna has warned him that expanding his business now is probably going to result in financial loss versus gain, Jordan has decided to move forward with his plans. What is most likely to be causing Jordan to make a decision that could harm his company? 
A. Overconfidence
B. Self-interest
C. Incrementalism
D. Framing

3. A
Overconfidence. Several things can cause business professionals to make poor, unethical decisions. Overconfidence is one factor that can affect a person's ability to make the right decision. Overconfident executives such as Jordan are often so sure of themselves that they can't see the risks involved in making one decision versus another, even when their colleagues warn them of possible negative consequences of their actions. Incrementalism is the diminishing of ethical values over time. Self-interest involves looking out for your own well-being, rather than making the ethical, right choice for the company and its employees. Framing is a tendency to respond to situations based on how those situations are posed or viewed.

4. The addition of too many workers on a job may cause the marginal product to turn 
A. positive.
B. upward.
C. variable.
D. negative.

4. D
Negative. The law of diminishing returns states that if all the factors of production remain the same except one, additions to the one variable factor will eventually decrease the level of productivity. If a business adds too many workers, the level of productivity will decrease and may even become negative if those workers do not have sufficient resources to function properly. A business with too many workers may end up spending more money to produce products than the products generate in income. At that point, the marginal product turns negative. The addition of too many workers does not cause the marginal product to turn upward or positive. Workers are a variable factor in production over which a business has control.

A. developing a target market analysis.
B. creating a budget for hiring increases.
C. examining the relevant costs of advertising options.
D. determining whether to make or buy a component.

5. C
Examining the relevant costs of advertising options. Managerial accountants can use techniques such as relevant cost analysis to assist marketers in making decisions regarding advertising options. They can determine which will have the lowest and highest costs. Determining whether to buy or make a component is not necessarily a marketing decision. Developing a target market analysis would generally not be a task for a managerial accountant. Creating a budget for hiring increases is not directly related to marketing products.

8. A strong professional relationship is usually a(n) __________ relationship. 
A. easily maintained
B. reciprocal
C. majority-rule
D. one-sided

8. B
Reciprocal. Strong professional relationships are essential for success in the finance industry, and for these relationships to be strong, they must also be reciprocal. A reciprocal relationship is one in which each member of the relationship helps the other. In finance, this usually means referring clients to each other for the different services that they require. For instance, a bank loan officer may refer clients to a particular insurance agent for their homeowners' insurance. Likewise, that insurance agent would refer clients interested in refinancing their mortgage or purchasing a home to the bank loan officer. A strong professional relationship in finance is not a one-sided or majority-rule relationship. Instead, the professionals should help each other and consider each other to be equals. A strong professional relationship is not necessarily easily maintained.

A. All former entities no longer exist, and a single, new legal entity is formed.
B. All entities continue operating, connected by a parent-subsidiary relationship.
C. The acquirer does not have to purchase 100% of the target company's equity.
D. One of the entities continues to exist, absorbing 100% of another entity's stock.

10. A
All former entities no longer exist, and a single, new legal entity is formed. A consolidation occurs when two businesses agree to create a new entity so that one business can take over the net assets of another entity; neither of the original entities continues to exist. After an acquisition, all entities continue operating, connected by a parent-subsidiary relationship. A merger occurs when a business absorbs 100% of another entity's stock and the acquirer continues to exist. In a consolidation, the acquirer purchases 100% of the target's equity, not less.

Firewall software. Firewalls are computer programs that secure and protect computer networks from unauthorized users. Spyware is a type of software that gathers information about a user's computer activity (e.g., browsing history) without their knowledge. Debugger applications help identify and correct computerprogramming errors. Compression software reduces the size of an electronic file, which reduces storage space and increases the speed of transmission.

Businesspeople can call customers from remote locations, check email, verify inventory levels, and place orders from smartphones. In many situations, smartphones reduce the need to carry laptops and tablet computers because many of the applications that salespeople need to conduct business are on these devices. Businesses can also send promotional messages to their customers' smartphones. Autoresponder applications provide email recipients the ability to send automatic messages back to the message sender (e.g., out-of-office announcements).

A. Create work subcultures
B. Collect information
C. Develop a mission statement

Communicate priorities. Employees carry out the work to achieve the organization's goals. To carry out the work, managers must communicate their work priorities to employees. When employees know and understand their priorities, they can perform the most important tasks before they tackle the less important tasks. An organization's mission statement guides the goal-setting process, but it does not provide specific information for completing specific work tasks. Although a variety of work subcultures (e.g., departmental, team, social) exist in most organizations, managers must communicate their work priorities to employees so that they can carry out tasks that will achieve organizational goals. Collected information must be communicated and acted upon to achieve the organization's goals.

17. A business buying certain office products from a specific vendor that delivers at predetermined times and guarantees a set price for one year is an example of using the __________ purchasing method. 
A. competitive-bid
B. lowest-bidder
C. standing-order
D. blank-check

17. C
Standing-order. Businesses often negotiate a long-term price from a specific vendor for various staple items such as office supplies. The vendor guarantees the price and delivers the products at regular intervals, such as every other day or twice a week. This is an example of the standing-order purchasing method because the vendor automatically delivers the predetermined amount at a predetermined time for a guaranteed price. The business does not need to call the vendor each time it needs an order of copy paper or toner. The competitivebid method involves obtaining several prices before placing an order, often with the vendor that offered the lowest bid. The blank-check method involves allowing some vendors to deliver goods without negotiating a price.

Pronounce their names correctly. One way to show respect for foreign clients, their families, and their cultures is to learn to say their names properly. If you mispronounce a client's name, you might insult the person or hurt their feelings. If you can speak a client's native tongue, converse with that client in their language rather than always speaking in your own native language.

C. alerts.
D. backup.

24. A
Tracking. Most personal and business budgeting applications allow users to connect their budgeting software directly to their bank accounts (e.g., checking and savings) and loans. Rather than manually entering every expense, automatic tracking transmits expense information from the bank to the budgeting application without human intervention. However, it is still wise for budgeting-software users to compare this information to physical receipts to verify that the data are accurate. An automatic backup system copies and saves computer files regularly to prevent loss of important data. Budgeting applications are typically programmed to provide users with automatic alerts—reminders—to make payments that are coming due. An affirmation is something you want to accept, incorporate, or develop. It typically refers to a present or desired strength.

If money was not spent on email marketing, it is possible that the campaigns planned in the budget were never carried out, which would not demonstrate efficient use of funds. Positive variance does not necessarily relate to the ineffectiveness of email marketing. If there is a positive variance, it would suggest that the budget allocated too much toward email marketing rather than not enough.

C. The manager of a restaurant selects the monthly menu and designs a newspaper advertisement.
D. The manager evaluates employee performance according to the owner's standard.

34. C
The manager of a restaurant selects the monthly menu and designs a newspaper advertisement. Selecting the menu and designing an advertisement represent a variety of tasks and also a high degree of latitude concerning decision-making. The relationship of scope and depth can change with a specific task, so the amount of scope and depth varies at different times. A manager developing a monthly work schedule is an example of high depth. Signing time cards is low scope. Following guidelines to evaluate performance is an example of low depth.

35. Reece Fashion is considering whether to continue producing one of its handbags. One manager argues that the material that the company purchased to make the handbags was extremely expensive, so production should be halted. However, another manager points out that the cost of this material should not be considered in the decision because 
A. it is a differential cost.
B. it is coming from a biased source.
C. it is a sunk cost.
D. it was the cheapest option.

35. C
It is a sunk cost. Sunk costs are those that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered by any decision. Because the material was already purchased, the cost cannot be recovered. Therefore, it should not be a factor when deciding whether or not to produce the handbags. There is no indication that the manager is a biased source of information or that the material purchased was the cheapest option. Differential cost is the difference in cost between two alternatives.

36. Katie has developed a new product idea and plans to share it at the next staff meeting. Katie knows that some coworkers will object to her idea. When her coworkers share concerns that her idea won't work, Katie should 
A. explain that there is no proof her idea wouldn't work.
B. remind her coworkers that they are sharing opinions, not facts.
C. acknowledge their concerns and respond in a respectful manner.
D. repeat her proposal because it is based on quality research.

36. C
Acknowledge their concerns and respond in a respectful manner. To objectively defend an idea, it is important to acknowledge any concerns, consider them, and respond in a respectful manner. Stating that there is no proof that the idea wouldn't work does little to defend the idea and does not demonstrate an objective attitude. While it may be true that Katie's coworkers are only sharing opinions, their opinions may be based on years of experience and should be considered. Information based on quality research can provide good insight, but repeating the information does little to defend against concerns and does not demonstrate objectivity.

38. When giving constructive criticism, it's important to do so in a __________ manner. 
A. public
B. nonthreatening
C. forceful
D. humorous

38. B
Nonthreatening. Constructive criticism should always be given in a nonthreatening way. People don't usually respond well to criticism when they're afraid. Criticism should never be given in public, as doing so could embarrass the message receiver. It's also best to avoid being forceful, as that might be perceived as threatening. While sometimes humor can help you deliver a bad message, it's a better idea to focus on being nonthreatening, thoughtful, and nonjudgmental instead of being funny.

A. Computer hacking
B. Gift giving
C. Entertaining
D. Tax reporting

39. D
Tax reporting. All businesses are required by law to report and pay a variety of taxes. Tax reporting is a legal consideration that pertains to accounting because income and expenses can be reported in different ways. For example, it is illegal for a business to misrepresent financial information to indicate a loss for the purpose of not paying taxes. It is also illegal for a business to fail to report and pay sales tax and payroll withholding tax for employees. Businesses need to be aware of legal issues to avoid potential problems. Gift giving, entertaining, and computer hacking are usually ethical considerations rather than legal considerations.

Capital stock and retained earnings. The statement of changes in equity, also known as the statement of changes in stockholders' or shareholders' equity, indicates changes in stockholders' equity accounts during a specified time period. The capital stock section of a statement of changes in stockholders' equity shows the current value of stocks issued, while the retained earnings section shows the value of any net income retained for business expansion minus any dividends declared as distributions to stockholders.

42. To reduce the risk of loss due to fire or power outages, a financial business should protect its computer data by 
A. monitoring data-transmission rates.
B. using encryption techniques.
C. implementing an authorization process.
D. conducting backup procedures.

42. D
Conducting backup procedures. Backup procedures involve duplicating computer entries, records, and transactions on a regular basis and storing the duplicate files in a different location. By having backup files, the business can retrieve information that might be lost due to a computer crash, a power outage, or a fire. Encryption is the process of transforming information into a secret code so that only the recipient can read it. An authorization process is a way to limit the access to certain information. Using encryption techniques, implementing an authorization process, and monitoring data-transmission rates are not ways in which a business can protect its computer data from loss due to fire or power outages.

Pinpoint exactly what you want to know. To create a successful multi-table query, the first step is figuring out exactly what question you want the database to answer. If you aren't exactly sure what you want to know, the database cannot provide you with the information you need. Determining the criteria for the query, locating the correct tables, and setting the correct join direction are all important steps to take before creating the query, but none of them will be successful unless the exact question has been determined first.

Access. Stewardship of a company's financial information is an aspect of financial information management. In other words, the financial information management function is responsible for protecting the quality and integrity of any financial information that the company possesses. Several types of financial information stewardship exist, including both access and definition stewardship. Access stewardship is the ability to decide who is permitted or denied access to data within the financial information management system. Definition stewardship is the ability to determine what data within the financial information management system mean. Environmental stewardship is not usually associated with financial information management; it involves responsibility for the protection and conservation of natural resources.

D. $550

48. C
$525. If Dante invests the check into his savings with an annual rate of 5%, it will be worth $525 in a year. The formula for calculating future value is Future Value = Present Value X (1 + Interest Rate). In this scenario, the present value is $500 and the interest rate is 5% (.05 as a decimal), making the equation 500 X (1 + .05). After adding the numbers in the bracket, multiply that sum by the present value of $500, which equals $525.

A. It builds and maintains public trust in the financial system.
B. It eliminates all risks an organization may face.
C. It makes it easier to manipulate the market or market prices.
D. It leads to decreased regulatory scrutiny and regulation.

50. A
It builds and maintains public trust in the financial system. Financial compliance is the regulation and enforcement of laws and rules in finance, the capital markets, and the banking system. It has several benefits, including building and maintaining the public's trust in the financial system, managing risk, and reducing financial crime, among others. While financial compliance advises companies how to avoid and address risk, it does not entirely eliminate it. Financial compliance was a result of increased regulatory scrutiny and regulation because of the 2008 financial crisis; financial compliance does not lead to decreased regulatory scrutiny and regulation. The crisis led to compliance departments becoming active in risk management rather than being in simply an advisory role. Manipulating the market or market prices is considered to be an unethical financial compliance practice rather than a benefit.

Actively participating in a local professional association for the finance industry. Active participation in a professional organization specific to the finance industry affords finance professionals the opportunity to serve on committees, hold offices, and attend seminars with other local finance professionals. This involvement may result in a long-term professional relationship for the participants. Regularly attending trade shows for the finance industry is more likely to result in short-term relationships.

Uses questionable tactics to achieve profitability. A business that continuously "pushes the limit" by using questionable tactics to earn or show profits may get a poor reputation. Customers may become distrustful of the business and decide to purchase elsewhere. Providing accurate information to stockholders, encouraging employees to report questionable or potentially unethical behavior, and requiring new suppliers to provide credit information are ethical actions and are less likely to damage a business's reputation than the use of questionable tactics.

Respect the opinions of others. Because of the diverse nature of the workplace, people from many different backgrounds and cultures often work together. These people frequently have different beliefs and opinions. Consequently, employees need to recognize that different people have different opinions and that those opinions should be respected. Employees will be better able to solve problems if they respect the opinions of others and try to find acceptable compromises. Taking sides in a conflict often divides the workforce and creates additional problems. The nature of problem-solving involves compromise rather than standing firm. Aggression is never the way to solve a problem.

58. B
Ensure their customers against certain risks. An insurance institution is a financial intermediary that ensures its customers against certain risks, such as car accidents, house fires, broken items, etc. Customers pay regular insurance premiums in return for this insurance. Banks are subject to federal and state oversight, while insurance companies are subject only to state-level regulation. The bank acts as a financial intermediary between savers and investors, as banks take deposits, pay interest for their use, and lend out money to borrowers who typically pay for it at a high interest rate. In addition, banks accept short-term deposits and make long-term loans, meaning there is a mismatch between their liabilities and assets. With insurance institutions, liabilities are based on certain events happening.

A balance sheet captures the financial condition of the business at a particular moment, showing how much money a business has, how much it owes, and how much belongs to owners or stockholders. A cash flow statement states how much money has flowed into and out of a business.

Business cycle risks. By investing their funds in many different countries, investors are able to diversify their risk and reduce their exposure to business cycle risks. However, financial globalization seems to increase the risks of “speculative bubbles” and “herd behavior” of investors. Liberalization is the removal of government regulations on the flow of capital and international trade. Many countries around the world have reduced or eliminated limits on foreigners' access to their financial markets. Capital appreciation occurs when stock that a person owns becomes worth more than what the person paid for it. Capital appreciation is a positive aspect of investing, not something to avoid.

64. B
Is independent of factors that are already satisfied. In developed societies where most people already have access to basic necessities like food and shelter, extrinsic motivation isn't as effective as intrinsic motivation. Because external, low-level needs are of lesser concern, a person's individual ambitions and hopes are a more powerful motivator. By nature, intrinsic motivation is not tied to external rewards, nor does it come from outside one's personal desires. Similarly, intrinsic motivation cannot be easily altered by one's environment, because it is rooted within one's pursuit of self-actualization.

Because Charlotte does more than simply sell investments to her clients, she is considered a fiduciary. An accountant gathers, records, organizes, and reports financial data. A credit analyst assesses the requests of individuals and businesses applying for loans, makes reports to the loan committee, and helps decide if the requests should be granted. Institutional investors are mutual fund managers, large investment firms, and significant holding companies who invest in the stock market.

69. Iliana, an accountant, provides information to executives about the costs of implementing recyclable packaging. This is an example of how 
A. financial information can assist in sustainability reporting.
B. financial information should only be shared with top-level executives.
C. accountants can help organizations use activity-based costing.
D. sustainability efforts are usually too expensive to implement.

69. A
Financial information can assist in sustainability reporting. One way that financial information can be used is to support sustainability reporting. Sustainability is the practice of focusing on meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their economic, environmental, and social needs. Using recyclable packaging is an example of a sustainable practice. By providing information about its cost, Iliana is helping her company use financial information for sustainability reporting. Sustainability efforts are not necessarily too expensive to implement. This example is not related to activity-based costing. Finally, financial information should not necessarily only be shared with top-level executives.

70. Which type of financial analysis is best for comparing a single company's historical financial information to determine trends? 
A. Liquidity analysis
B. Horizontal analysis
C. Vertical analysis
D. Leverage analysis

70. B
Horizontal analysis. Horizontal analyses compare the information from a single company's income statements over multiple years. This allows analysts to determine trends and make forecasts for future performance. Vertical analyses are used in comparing companies within the same industry, even companies of vastly different sizes. This is because a vertical analysis of an income statement results in the calculation of multiple ratios, which are more easily compared across multiple companies of different sizes than are dollars. Leverage analyses are effective at determining company performance by resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio. These are typically performed with income statement information for a single year. Liquidity analyses are performed with information from a company's balance sheet to determine if a company is able to meet its short-term debts.

A. To monitor aging accounts
B. To classify stocks
C. To forecast sales
D. To evaluate interest rates

72. A
To monitor aging accounts. The accounts receivable—all the monies owed to a firm by its customers—should be monitored carefully because they affect the business's cash flow and its ability to pay its employees and creditors. To collect the monies owed to them, the business should implement follow-up procedures to contact customers with delinquent or aging accounts. Businesses do not monitor accounts-receivable information to forecast sales, classify stocks, or evaluate interest rates.

Employer-employee. In legal terms, the employer-employee relationship refers to the amount of control that a principal (e.g., employer or client) has over an agent (e.g., employee or attorney). Determining if a employeremployee relationship exists is an important consideration when addressing a business's legal issues and disputes, especially in cases that involve liability questions. Factors that determine if a employer-employee relationship exists include the nature of the agent's work, the level of the agent's control (e.g., decision-making), and the agent's level of supervision.

75. A
Data cleansing. If the data contained in a business's customer-relationship-management (CRM) system is incorrect, out-of-date, duplicated, or unformatted, the value and effectiveness of the CRM system is potentially compromised. Therefore, it is in the business's best interest to cleanse the data in its system on a regular—or even continual—basis. The correction, removal, and/or formatting of questionable customer records is called data cleansing. Environmental scanning involves collecting information about the environment surrounding a business. Technical analysis involves using historical information from market activity, prices, and volume to evaluate securities and predict future price activity. Exploratory research is a form of marketing research used to collect information that will help the business define its issue, situation, or concern and decide which direction to go in to address it.

A. Asset turnover
B. Profit margin
C. Working capital

Working capital. Working capital is a measure of short-term financial health that can be found by subtracting current liabilities from current assets. It indicates whether or not a company can cover its current debts, so it is the appropriate technique to provide Makayla with the information she needs. Debit/Equity ratio shows the relationship between total liabilities and shareholders' equity. It indicates how much debt a company is using to finance its assets. This ratio will not provide the information that Makayla needs. Asset turnover ratio measures sales revenue in relation to the value of assets. It indicates efficiency of performance, which is not what Makayla needs to know. Finally, profit margin demonstrates the amount of each dollar of sales that is kept in earnings. This is not related to Makayla's inquiry.

Seniority. Seniority refers to the length of time an individual has been employed by a business. Those who have been employed the longest have the most seniority. When all other factors, such as ability and competence, are equal, businesses often promote on the basis of seniority. The feeling often is that a competent person who has been with the company for a long time is entitled to a promotion before a competent person who has less time on the job. It is illegal for businesses to promote employees based on their gender or age. Tenure is a status given to teachers after a certain amount of time that protects them from being dismissed.

Provide feedback to improve objectives. The board of directors should obtain feedback from employees about the company's direction. This can help improve governance objectives and align them with the company's vision. In this way, employees have a say in the company's goals and will be more likely to work toward achieving them. Drafting bylaws is generally the role of an organization's founders or directors, rather than employees. Creating policies to enforce objectives is usually a task for the board of directors, rather than employees. Reporting progress to shareholders is also generally the responsibility of the board members, rather than that of employees.

84. A
Organize content in a cohesive, manageable way. Long business reports often contain a lot of information about different topics. To organize the information so the audience can understand the report's contents, report writers often break content into chunks of related information. Headings and subheadings are often included before the section or topic to let the audience know the issue at hand. Headings and subheadings do attract attention because they are often formatted with a larger or color-coded font; however, the primary purpose is not to convey a hidden agenda, provide supporting evidence, or solicit an opinion from the audience.

Amount due on an inheritance. A tax liability is a debt, or the total amount of tax an individual owes. There are many types of taxes, and one of them is an inheritance tax. When individuals receive an inheritance, they usually have to pay tax on at least a portion of the inheritance based on the amount of the inheritance. The inheritance tax is a debt that individuals must pay when they receive an inheritance. Deductions for a charitable contribution, interest paid on a mortgage, and the value of an exemption reduce the tax liability on the amount of income that a person earns.

88. Drew, a high-ranking employee at a wealthy corporation, received word that a product his company produces will need a massive recall, which will likely result in the company's stock price falling.

A. internet fraud.
B. pump-and-dump schemes.
C. insider trading.
D. boiler room tactics.

88. C
Insider trading. Insider trading is the buying or selling of a public company's stock by an individual who has nonpublic, confidential information about the company or the stock. It also includes tipping others off when one has nonpublic, confidential information. Because Drew informed his friend of the recall before the news was made public, allowing them to sell their stock before the price decreases, Drew was partaking in illegal insider trading. Boiler room tactics are high-pressure sales tactics used by salespeople to persuade investors to purchase speculative or fraudulent securities. Internet fraud is the use of online services or software to commit cybercrime, defraud victims, and take advantage of victims. Pump-and-dump schemes attempt to boost the price of a stock or security through false, misleading, fake, or exaggerated statements or recommendations.

B. being honest should weed out the people who aren't dedicated to the job.
C. employees are not legally allowed to work more than 40 hours per week.
D. employees who are overburdened are unlikely to stay with the company.

89. D
Employees who are overburdened are unlikely to stay with the company. It can be tempting for entrepreneurs to sugarcoat the amount of time and effort that will be needed from employees—but this approach is destined to backfire. Employees who are hired under the impression that they will only work 20 hours per week, for example, will certainly not appreciate it when they are told they actually need to work 30 or 40, especially if their compensation doesn't increase accordingly. If workers are consistently overburdened, they are unlikely to stay with the company for very long—and will probably resent the company's management in the meantime. Entrepreneurs shouldn't discriminate against people with busy personal lives when hiring employees. Many people are able to effectively balance an active personal and professional life. Being honest is important so that employees know what to expect at work. The primary purpose of honesty in the employee search is not to weed out people who are not dedicated to the job—it's to provide transparency for all prospective workers. It is not true that employees are not legally allowed to work more than 40 hours per week.

B. To understand potential risk
C. To determine the average price
D. To solve for mode

93. B
To understand potential risk. Standard deviation is used to measure the differences or distances of data points from the mean of the data set. Analysts often use the standard deviation to help determine an investment's volatility. An investment with a high standard deviation is more volatile than one with a low standard deviation. Analysts already know the average or mean of the data when they calculate standard deviation. The range is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in a data set. The mode is the number that appears the most in a data set.

Board members have a fiduciary responsibility to the organization, so they must always act for its benefit. An actuary is a person who assesses risk. Ad hoc means short-term or created for a particular or temporary reason. Fair market typically refers to fair market value and means a company's worth according to the marketplace.

Being insulting or rude. Businesspeople need to be aware of cultural differences in order to avoid accidentally insulting or being rude to businesspeople from other parts of the world.

In some countries it is rude to start and end a meeting on time, but that is the standard in other countries.

98. The accounting staff at the Sun Valley Granola Company recently completed their annual review of the company's budget. The team noticed that the company spent more money on advertising and promotion in the last year than on quality control. One staff member remarked that the company had been receiving an increase in complaints from dissatisfied customers than in previous years. What function of financial information management did the company neglect in this situation? 
A. Policy setting
B. Planning
C. Budgeting
D. Stewardship

98. D
Stewardship. Financial stewardship involves ensuring that a company's financial resources are allocated appropriately and ethically to fulfill the company's mission. In this situation, the Sun Valley Granola Company failed to engage in financial stewardship because it spent more money promoting its products than ensuring that its products were high-quality. There is not enough information given in this example to determine whether the company neglected to plan, budget, or set policies.

99. When a business actively takes steps to ensure that it is complying with safety standards, its goal is to reduce 
A. property disputes.
B. social responsibility.
C. liability exposure.
D. fraudulent activity.

99. C
Liability exposure. Businesses are morally obligated to be cautious and behave in ways that are not harmful to others. A business that takes steps to ensure that its facilities are safe tends to run a lower risk of liability exposure (e.g., lawsuits, damaged reputation, and financial loss). Complying with safety standards does not reduce a business's obligation to be socially responsible. Fraudulent activity involves dishonest behavior such as theft. Property disputes are conflicts associated with the use or ownership of land and buildings.

100. Why are financial institutions using tokenization? 
A. To protect online transactions
B. To overcome government-regulated quotas
C. To provide incentives for increased investing
D. To create credit cards

100. A
To protect online transactions. Tokenization is the process of substituting a random number in place of an account number to process the transaction online. In this way, financial institutions are able to protect customer data from fraud. Credit card creation, provision of incentives, and government-required quotas are not aspects of tokenization.
