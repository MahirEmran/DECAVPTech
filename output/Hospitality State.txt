1. One of the reasons why a chain of hotels might analyze and interpret the marketing information contained in databases is to 
A. compare variables.
B. organize products.
C. tabulate findings.
D. survey guests.

1. A
Compare variables. A chain of hotels might analyze and interpret the marketing information contained in databases in order to compare several variables that change from property to property. For example, one hotel might be located in an affluent suburb while another one is located in an urban area. The chain might analyze the information in its database concerning both communities in order to make appropriate marketing decisions such as the types of services to offer in each location. Although the chain provides the same types of goods and services to both communities, it needs to analyze data in order to know if the consumers in each community have different wants and needs. Before analyzing databases to compare variables, a chain of hotels might survey guests and tabulate the findings. A chain would not analyze databases in order to organize products.

A. The amount of sleep people need varies from person to person.
B. Going to bed early will ensure that you get enough sleep.
C. The amount of sleep you get does not affect your health.
D. Everyone needs eight hours of sleep each night.

2. A
The amount of sleep people need varies from person to person. It was once thought that everyone needed eight hours of sleep every night. Studies now indicate that is not true. While the amount of sleep you get will affect your health, you have to determine what amount is right for you. Going to bed early may give you an adequate amount of rest, but it does not guarantee the amount of sleep you will get.

A. practicing the delivery.

3. A
Practicing the delivery. When preparing to deliver an oral presentation, practicing the delivery is most important because it uncovers any problems with timing, transitions, note cards, visual aids, and even language. Conducting research, writing useful note cards, and choosing the best visual aid are all important steps, but they do not affect other areas as much as practice does.

D. product bundling.

4. D
Product bundling. Product bundling occurs when a company sells a group of products for a lower price than if the consumer purchased each product separately. One common “bundle” includes internet, phone, and TV service. Consumer demand, product separation, and combined marketing are not terms used to describe product bundling.

D. Employees engage in team-building exercises.

5. C
Emmie praises her employees for quality work. Motivation is the process of getting employees to strive to achieve management's objectives because they want to achieve them. Emmie is motivating her employees by offering them praise when they achieve high-quality work. Paying attention to what time employees clock in, team-building activities, and asking an employee to stay late to finish a project are not necessarily examples of motivation.

A. number of multinationals.
B. volume of production.
C. balance of payments.
D. need for trade missions.

6. C
Balance of payments. Balance of payments is the difference between all monies coming into a country and going out of a country. Nations need to have more money coming in than going out. The volume of production is recorded to calculate productivity levels. The number of multinationals would show how many businesses have facilities located abroad. A trade mission is a group of volunteer businesspeople sponsored by the government to inform exporters about foreign markets.

A. Brand awareness
B. Brand preference
C. Brand insistence
D. Brand recognition

7. C
Brand insistence. Brand insistence is the final stage of brand loyalty in which consumers insist upon buying a specific brand. Brand awareness is one of the first stages of branding and is the extent to which customers or potential customers are familiar with a brand. Brand preference comes before insistence and is the stage of brand loyalty in which consumers prefer to purchase a certain brand but will accept substitutes if the brand is not available. Brand recognition is the stage of brand loyalty in which consumers are made aware of a brand's existence.

Your work experiences that relate to the job opening. The letter of application is intended to provide information about the job applicant so the reader understands how the applicant is qualified for a specific job opening. It should stress the applicant's strengths so the reader knows the person's qualifications and feels positively about them. References are often provided once requested by the employer and are not necessary in a letter of application. Only relevant information should be presented in the letter of application.

Brand cue. Brand cues are simple reminders of the brand's identity and values. Brand cues are a great way to remind employees about the brand values and brand promise. Touchpoints are all the opportunities that businesses have to connect with customers and reinforce their brand. Logos are distinctive symbols, designs, or groups of letters.

Investing in invoice tracking software. Invoice tracking software makes it easy to manage invoices automatically and integrate the invoicing process with the rest of business operations. Only accepting electronic payments will not necessarily make it easier to track invoices. Limiting a client base is not necessarily a smart business decision and will not help the business grow.

13. A
Personal selling. Personal selling is planned, personalized communication intended to influence purchase decisions. It is often used with high-priced or complex items. Advertising can be used to attract people to the business but is not generally used by salespeople. Publicity is any nonpersonal presentation of ideas, goods, or services that is not paid for by the individual or business that receives it. Sales promotion is activities such as couponing, displays, contests, free samples, or rebates used to stimulate purchases. These are initiated by the business, not the salesperson.

15. A
Trademarked. A trademark is a symbol, design, or word used to identify a good or service and registered with the government to prevent use by others. A patent is the legal protection of an invention or a process granted by government to its owners for a certain number of years. Notarizing authenticates a document legally (normally used for titles, affidavits, depositions, etc.). Audits are used to verify a company's accounts, records, and financial data.

A. less employee turnover.
B. more absenteeism.
C. lower health care costs.
D. increased productivity.

16. B
More absenteeism. Stress can lead to absenteeism and tardiness at work. When absent workers are the norm, employers have a hard time relying on employees, adhering to deadlines, and getting work done. Employers, therefore, should take steps to limit employee stress as much as they can. High stress in the workplace also leads to decreased productivity, increased health care costs, and higher employee turnover.

17. One of the best ways to demonstrate exemplary customer service in the hospitality and tourism industry is to 
A. offer discounts.
B. be frugal.
C. waive late fees.
D. be proactive.

17. D
Be proactive. While businesses should do everything they can to resolve customer issues once they are received, it's also important to anticipate any issues to improve the customer experience. Anticipating these issues—or being proactive—helps prevent the customer from having a negative experience. While offering discounts or waiving late fees can be a nice touch, these actions don't take the place of strong customer service. Being frugal involves aiming to spend only a small amount of money when possible. Being smart with money is advantageous to businesses, but being frugal all of the time does not help businesses offer exemplary customer service.

C. Fluctuations in gasoline prices
D. Hotel and restaurant construction

18. A
Floods and severe storm damage. Floods and storms can cause damage that shuts down lodging facilities, restaurants, tourist attractions, airports, and roads. When businesses are not operating and generating income, the local economy is negatively impacted. Occasional airline delays and minor fluctuations in gasoline prices are normal, so these factors do not typically negatively affect a community's economic health. Hotel and restaurant construction indicates that the local economy is growing.

A. Product versatility, advertising strategies, and personal circumstances
B. Personal circumstances, type of business, and product mix
C. Personal circumstances, financial needs, and type of business

19. C
Personal circumstances, financial needs, and type of business. Because each business owner's situation is unique, the owner must consider the type of business being operated, the amount of capital needed to start the business, and the owner's personal circumstances. For example, an independently wealthy, single person who starts a consulting business has different needs than a chef who has little capital and wants to open a fullservice restaurant. Product versatility, advertising strategies, and product mix are not generally considered when determining the appropriate business ownership structure.

A. putting individual price tickets on goods.
B. being familiar with regular product prices.
C. using more than one price ticket on goods.
D. using cost codes on all price tickets.

21. B
Being familiar with regular product prices. Employees who are familiar with regular prices will notice an item that seems to be priced too low. They can take a moment to verify the price without offending an honest customer. A dishonest customer will realize the business is watching for attempts at fraud. The use of cost codes on price tickets and the use of more than one price ticket are not effective prevention practices because price-ticket switching can still go unnoticed if employees are not familiar with the prices. Not using price tickets on items creates unfavorable shopping conditions for customers and requires additional time for salespeople to check prices.

A. During checkout
B. After posting charges
C. After posting credits
D. During check-in

22. D
During check-in. Hotel employees should inform guests of the hotel's services and amenities during the checkin process. Guests who are not aware that the hotel offers certain services will not use them, which can affect the guests' experience during their stay and can affect the hotel's sales. For example, a guest who does not realize that the hotel has an on-site restaurant will not dine there. As a result, the hotel's food and beverage division loses potential revenue. Advising guests about services during checkout is not beneficial to the guest or to the hotel. Posting is a term that describes adding or subtracting charges to a guest's bill.

A. psychological
B. social
C. cultural
D. situational

23. D
Situational. There are times when specific situations can override the more dominant influences on buying behavior, such as culture or personality. While Monika might not normally spend money when dining out, she made an exception in this case because it was a special occasion: her sister's birthday. Psychological influence involves a consumer's perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes within their own reality. Social interactions have a strong effect on your buying behavior, as much of what you know about making purchases you've learned by watching family and friends. The most significant influence on buying behavior is culture, which is the system of values, traditions, and preferences that is handed down from one generation to the next.

A. A business will make more money.
B. A business will sell more of the product.
C. Customers will spend their money elsewhere.
D. Customers will continue to buy the product.

26. C
Customers will spend their money elsewhere. Pricing is like a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Both are trying to get the most value from the good or service. The trick to pricing comes in balancing and satisfying both groups. Both buyers and sellers need to perceive that they are getting the best possible value they can. If this doesn't happen, customers may spend their money elsewhere, either on a similar product (if one is available) or on an entirely different product. A business may make less money if both buyers and sellers don't think that they are getting the best possible value. Customers are not likely to continue to buy the product, and the business is not likely to sell more of the product.

Implement cybersecurity training for employees. Many cybersecurity breaches occur because of human error from within an organization. Employees may unwittingly leak sensitive customer data or fall prey to internal phishing scams. For this reason, it is essential that hospitality and tourism companies implement cybersecurity training for employees. Employees should be educated on the proper handling of private information as well as how to recognize signs of suspicious activity. Companies should not simply trust that employees will adequately protect customer data; they should educate their employees so that they are properly prepared. At the same time, they should not assume that employees are completely incapable of protecting customer data. Most employees are willing and able to learn how to better protect customer data.

36. As Ross develops his departmental budget, he must demonstrate the need for every expense and not rely on historical data. What method of budgeting is Ross using? 
A. Master
B. Rolling
C. Zero-based
D. Relational

36. C
Zero-based. Budgets are estimations of income and expenses. In zero-based budgeting, managers are required to show the need for every expense that they expect their departments or companies to incur within a set time period. A rolling or continuous budget replaces each passing month with a new month added to the end of the budget, so that there is always a year-long budget in place. A master budget is a comprehensive budget for the entire company and includes all company functions and departments. Relational is not a type of budget.

A. Decreasing competition
B. Increasing tax rates
C. Running community affairs
D. Creating jobs

39. D
Creating jobs. Increased employment in a community results in an increased local tax base. A larger tax base increases a community's service offerings to residents. Also, merchants will benefit from the increased spending power of citizens who work and, thereby, encourage competition for their consumer dollars. Tax rates will not usually be increased because of businesses. Businesses may participate in, but do not usually run, community affairs.

40. When writing a persuasive business message, you should remember to 
A. communicate your personal goals.
B. describe the benefits to the audience.
C. open the message with a meaningful quote.
D. place the least important information at the beginning.

40. B
Describe the benefits to the audience. The primary goal of a persuasive message is to influence behavior. Influencing others involves communicating benefits of taking action. The readers are more likely to respond favorably to the message if they know how the action will impact or help them. Communicating benefits is a central element to all types of persuasive messages. The beginning of the message should catch the readers' attention and encourage them to read more. Depending on the type of message, this might involve a quote. The message should be concise, so it should not contain unimportant information. The message should be written to communicate the business's goals rather than personal ones.

41. Rather than relying solely on a reception desk in the lobby, a hotel checks in its guests by using tablets that can access the hotel management system anywhere in the building to increase efficiency and convenience. This is an example of __________ impacting the hospitality and tourism industry. 
A. globalization
B. social media
C. personalization
D. mobile devices

41. D
Mobile devices. A mobile device is a computer that is small enough to be handheld, such as a smartphone or tablet. The small size of the device allows for greater mobility than a larger, stagnant computer and provides increased efficiency and convenience for consumers. Social media include forms of electronic communications through which users build communities, network, share information, etc. Globalization is the rapid and unimpeded flow of capital, labor, and ideas across national borders. Personalization involves tailoring a product or service to fit individual needs or wants. Social media, globalization, and personalization are not demonstrated in this example.

46. The question "Are you traveling for business or pleasure?" is an example of a __________ segmentation inquiry. 
A. demographic
B. psychographic
C. choreographic
D. geographic

46. B
Psychographic. Psychographic segmentation is the division of a market on the basis of customers' personalities and lifestyles, including income, interests, and activities. People traveling for business can have vastly different price points and planned activities than those traveling for pleasure, so asking whether they are traveling for business or pleasure gives employees a better sense of their psychographic needs. Geographic segmentation is the division of a market on the basis of where customers are located. Demographic segmentation is the division of a market on the basis of its physical and social characteristics. Choreographic refers to dancing and is not a type of segmentation.

Revolving. A revolving credit account limits the total amount of money that may be owed. Revolving account customers who do not pay the full amount each month are charged interest on the unpaid balance. A budget credit plan is a short-term credit plan, typically for two to three months. An open (account) credit plan is a regular credit plan requiring payment in full at the end of each credit period. A coupon credit plan issues coupons to be paid for over a period of time and to be used by customers in making purchases.

Measuring the success of marketing campaigns. Web analytics allow you to collect data about visitors to your website. One of the benefits of doing so is being able to measure the success of digital marketing campaigns. You can track which campaigns lead to more page views and clicks, which allows you to make smarter marketing decisions in the future. While tracking analytics can help you reduce page bounces, it does not prevent them altogether. Tracking analytics is not necessarily related to discovering new sales tactics.

D. privacy.

50. B
Confidentiality. Confidentiality refers to the agreement of an individual or party not to share the sensitive information of another individual or party. Most lawyers have confidentiality agreements with their clients that protect the sensitive details of the clients' cases from being shared with others. While similar to confidentiality, privacy and security differ in important ways. Privacy is the right of an individual to keep their information to themselves, while security is the protection of sensitive data or items that are housed in a database or other storage facility.

Many hospitality businesses offer valet parking as a service for their guests. Valet parking service occurs when a hotel or restaurant employee parks and retrieves the guests' vehicles upon the guests' arrival or departure from the business (e.g., hotel, restaurant).

A. Apologize and attempt to rectify the problem
B. Ask the customer to comment again explaining the problem in more detail
C. Ignore the negative comment so others aren't encouraged to follow suit
D. Reply with a witty comment to improve brand image

52. A
Apologize and attempt to rectify the problem. When a company receives a negative review on social media, it should use the platform to publicly acknowledge the customer. This gives the customer the attention and respect they are seeking, as well as demonstrating that the company cares about its customers. The company should not ignore the negative comment because this makes it appear that the customer's opinion does not matter. Replying with a witty comment will not necessarily improve brand image because the customer might feel insulted or belittled. While it is a good idea to gather more information about the problem, it might be wise for the company to do so privately rather than publicly in a comment.

56. D
To provide a way for travelers to share their experiences. The internet has provided a mechanism through social media for satisfied and unsatisfied customers to tell others about their experiences with a business. The comments of other customers are viewed as more credible statements than advertisements from the business. Therefore, travel and tourism businesses are providing this forum so that satisfied customers can spread the good word, while any problems identified can be addressed and corrections made, if needed.

By presenting her data in a pie chart, Hannah helped her managers understand the most important takeaways from the data set. There are disadvantages to using charts, graphs, and tables, too. For example, these visuals can often make complicated issues seem less important than they truly are, leading the audience to miss out on the complexity of the problem or issue at hand. Similarly, charts, tables, and graphs do not allow the audience to absorb all of the details and intricacies of the data set being presented.

A. Luncheon for employees who turn in reports on time
B. Bonus of $500 for finishing a project early
C. Airline ticket to the employee who recycles the most over one year
D. Extra day of vacation for riding a bike to work instead of driving

63. D
Extra day of vacation for riding a bike to work instead of driving. Biking reduces car pollution. When others see the company's employees riding their bikes, it reinforces the company's image as environmentally friendly. The company is encouraging this behavior by offering a reward. A bonus of $500 for finishing a project early may be important to employees and effective in motivating them to work efficiently, but it is not seen by others outside the organization so it doesn't reinforce the company's image. In addition, finishing early is not an activity that is perceived as environmentally friendly. Although recycling does reinforce the "green" image, there are two problems with this response. First, those outside the company aren't likely to see employees recycling, so it won't boost the company's image. Second, airplanes pollute the environment, so the award is not aligned with the company's green image. The luncheon may motivate employees to turn in reports in a timely manner, but nothing about this incentive or reward reinforces the company's environmentally friendly image.

A. implementing a mailing system.
B. processing a financial transaction.
C. guaranteeing product satisfaction.
D. reducing the possibility of counterfeiting.

64. B
Processing a financial transaction. When selling goods or services over the telephone, it is necessary to process the financial transaction. Many customers order products over the phone and pay with a credit card. When the business takes the credit card information from the customer, it then processes the information to complete the transaction of transferring funds to the business's account. Once the transaction is completed, the business has received payment for the tickets. Taking a customer's order over the phone and accepting payment with a credit card does not guarantee product satisfaction or reduce the possibility of counterfeiting. In many cases, products purchased over the phone are mailed to customers. However, taking the order and accepting payment is not an example of implementing a mailing system.

A. second
B. first
C. ultimate
D. zero

66. C
Ultimate. Heather writing a positive review of the phone case and sharing the information with her family members, friends, and colleagues is an example of the ultimate moment of truth. The ultimate moment of truth is the final stage in shaping a meaningful experience for the customer. It is when the customer begins to share their experiences with others and thus creates more zero moments of truth (the first possible moment of contact between a brand or product and the customer). When a problem arises, the customer will go searching for a solution. The first moment of truth occurs when the potential customer first comes into contact with a specific product. It focuses on the impression they form when they see the product for the first time and learn more about it. The second moment of truth takes place when the customer truly experiences what the company is offering. It is the ongoing relationship with a product and the things customers can think, see, hear, touch, or smell about the product or brand over the lifetime of the relationship.

A. Sims Steakhouse received six out of eight cases of glassware on Monday because the vendor ran out of
stock. B. The Powell Company did not order enough paper towels for the month, so it ordered an additional four
cases. C. Mr. and Mrs. Travis ordered a dining-room set in a wood finish that the furniture store doesn't normally

68. B
The Powell Company did not order enough paper towels for the month, so it ordered an additional four cases. A reorder involves ordering items that the company has previously ordered. The Powell Company placed a reorder because it submitted a second order for the same product (paper towels) to its vendor. A backorder occurs when a vendor ships part of an order on time and the rest of the order later when the stock is available. Mr. and Mrs. Travis placed a special order, which is a request for a custom item that a vendor does not normally carry in stock. Henry's Hardware Store placed a regular order, which involves providing the vendor with the specifications of items that the business wants to order.

69. The SleepRight Motel has three floors of guest rooms, each with their own direct exit outside. The evacuation protocol for the motel is to direct guests out of their rooms and down the nearest flight of stairs. The Crowne Plaza Hotel is a fifteen-floor luxury hotel with fourteen floors of guest suites and one floor of ballrooms and administrative offices. The evacuation plan for the Crowne Plaza Hotel is to direct guests into the hallways to the nearest elevator or flight of stairs, depending on the circumstance. These examples demonstrate how __________ affects evacuation procedures in the hospitality industry. 
A. severe weather
B. building layout
C. guest count
D. government regulation

69. B
Building layout. Building size and layout greatly influence the specific evacuation procedures and protocols for a hotel or motel. Smaller buildings, such as motels, may have simpler evacuation plans, while larger hotels and resorts may have more complicated procedures to ensure visitor safety. Guest count, government regulation, and severe weather may also affect evacuation procedures; however, they are not demonstrated in this example.

A. are often seen by people other than the recipients.
B. should be written in an entertaining, informal way.
C. are usually deleted as soon as they are read.
D. should include graphics to hold the reader's interest.

70. A
Are often seen by people other than the recipients. When writing emails to customers and coworkers, the correspondence should address various business issues; therefore, writers should develop the messages using a concise, friendly, and businesslike tone. If the writer uses language that is very casual, personal, or questionable, there is a risk of offending the recipient or others to whom the recipient forwards the message. Because many businesses have email policies and can monitor the contents of emails going into and out of their companies, email writers should take care not to send inappropriate messages. Business emails do not need to be entertaining or informal, nor do they need to include graphics. Many businesspeople save important emails and flag them for follow-up at a later time.

71. Which of the following is a benefit of the division of labor: 
A. More direct oversight
B. Teamwork opportunities
C. Professional development
D. Increased efficiency

71. D
Increased efficiency. Division of labor is the process of dividing a large job into units, or job tasks, and assigning an individual to do each of the tasks. Division of labor allows for specialization, which makes organizations more efficient because the work is divided and shared to take advantage of employees’ skills. Division of labor does not necessarily lead to more direct oversight, teamwork opportunities, or professional development.

72. What is one thing you can do to protect yourself from becoming a victim of identity theft? 
A. Use unusual passwords rather than your birth date to access your bank accounts.
B. Always pay with cash rather than credit cards or check.
C. Keep your passport with you at all times.
D. Place your Social Security number on all documents.

72. A
Use unusual passwords rather than your birth date to access your bank accounts. Identity theft occurs when somebody uses another individual's name and personal information (e.g., credit cards) for fraudulent purposes. Identity theft can occur even when you take precautions. To reduce the risk of identity theft, use unusual passwords to access your personal bank accounts rather than common information such as your birth date. To further prevent identity theft, do not place your Social Security number on unnecessary documents. Many people do not have passports. Paying with cash is not always a good idea, because cancelled bank checks serve as a receipt for payments. If you pay your bills by sending cash, the envelope may get lost, and you will have no record of making the payment. In addition, using credit cards wisely can help you build a good credit report, which will help you obtain loans for expensive items (e.g., a car) in the future.

A. avoid direct contact with sharp objects and bacteria.
B. reduce the risk of inhaling dangerous fumes.
C. prevent damage to the floors and furniture.
D. decrease the risk of security breaches.

73. A
Avoid direct contact with sharp objects and bacteria. Wearing disposable gloves when emptying trash containers prevents direct skin contact with bacteria, sharp objects (e.g., broken glass), and dangerous chemicals that can harm the employee's hands and spread blood-borne pathogens. Wearing disposable gloves does not prevent damage to floors and furniture, decrease the risk of security breaches, or reduce the risk of inhaling dangerous fumes. To reduce exposure to fumes, employees should wear ventilation masks.

A. Repeat business
B. Personal service
C. Individual priority
D. Pleasant experience

75. A
Repeat business. Employees who solve customers’ problems quickly and satisfactorily often are able to obtain repeat business from those customers. Customers who are treated well will likely return to the business in spite of the complaint because they know the employees will resolve whatever problems may arise. Customers, not employees, obtain individual priority, personal service, and a pleasant experience when employees quickly handle problems and complaints.

The work team is likely to go along with the change because Alicia has 
A. demonstrated empathy.
B. exhibited cultural sensitivity.
C. coached others effectively.
D. established personal credibility.

76. D
Established personal credibility. Credibility is believability. To be able to persuade others, individuals need to be credible so others believe what they say. Individuals who are credible have a reputation of providing accurate information in a fair manner. They are well-informed and use reliable sources to support their opinions and ideas. As a result, others believe them and often are persuaded to do what they want. Because Alicia is an honest person who has prior experience with the process, she has credibility.

Bookmarking. The bookmarking computer tool allows users to save URL addresses on their computers. The bookmarking tool allows users to quickly return to favorite or frequently visited websites without reentering a specific URL address every time they want to access the websites. This is a beneficial tool for businesspeople who need to do ongoing research, or for employees who need to access vendor and customer websites several times a day.

78. Melanie recently graduated from college with a degree in hospitality management and has good organizational, communication, and management skills. Melanie enjoys traveling, sailing, and planning social events. Which of the following jobs in the hospitality and tourism industry best matches Melanie's skills and interests: 
A. Ship safety officer
B. Resort housekeeping manager
C. Cruise director
D. Hotel food and beverage manager

78. C
Cruise director. Cruise directors perform a variety of tasks. Primary responsibilities involve coordinating entertainment activities and special events for the cruise's passengers. Coordinating these activities requires communicating with and managing staff. Because Melanie enjoys traveling, water sports (sailing), and planning social events, a cruise-director position aligns with her skills and interests. Working as a food and beverage manager usually requires specialized training in food preparation and service. Housekeeping managers perform management tasks associated with the cleaning and upkeep of rooms. Because Melanie likes to travel and plan special events, she would probably not want to work as a resort housekeeping manager. A safety officer needs to have special knowledge about the security and safety issues that pertain to cruise ships.

79. Which of the following is a good strategy for resolving a customer service issue: 
A. Keep the conversation in a public space
B. Agree with the customer's complaints
C. Allow the customer to express their feelings
D. Disagree with each negative statement

79. C
Allow the customer to express their feelings. Sometimes, frustrated customers want to complain and release anger. Allowing them to express their feelings might help them calm down and make a resolution more likely. Agreeing with a customer's complaints is not a good idea, because it undermines the authority of the company. Keeping the conversation in a public space is not a good idea, because other employees or customers might hear the conversation, which could damage morale and reputation. Finally, disagreeing with each negative statement is likely to upset the customer rather than help resolve the conflict.

Discover the customer’s needs. Only by discovering the needs of the customer through questioning and listening will the salesperson be in a position to recommend a good or service that will meet those needs. This process may indicate the customer’s mood, but that is not its purpose. The method of follow-up depends upon the selling situation. Feature-benefit selling is convincing customers that a good or service has the features that will provide the benefits they are looking for.

A. mention that you work on commission.
B. help customers make good buying decisions.
C. recommend at least three additional items.
D. suggest the better quality, higher priced item.

81. B
Help customers make good buying decisions. Customer satisfaction should be the final goal and outcome of the entire selling process. While suggestion selling/upselling can benefit the company, salespeople, and customers, it is important to only suggest additional items that would be valuable for the customer. When upselling, it is smart to limit your suggestion to just one or two additional products. Mentioning that you work on commission will not help with upselling and instead might make customers lose trust in you as a salesperson. The better quality, higher priced item is not always the best fit for a customer. Salespeople should take customer budgets into account when selling items.

82. The manager of the Majesty Resort just quit in the middle of summer vacation season. They told the owner they felt too overwhelmed by all of the work they had to do. The owner of the Majesty Resort should have 
A. increased staffing for peaks in demand.
B. closed down the resort during peaks in demand.
C. convinced the manager to stay.
D. hired a more responsible manager.

82. A
Increased staffing for peaks in demand. Employee turnover can become a problem during peaks in demand, when employees (such as the manager in this example) become overworked and stressed. This issue could have been avoided by increasing staffing to meet demand. Hiring a more responsible manager might not necessarily help, because there still might not be enough staff to handle the demands of the busiest seasons. Convincing the manager to stay would also not help with the excessive demand unless other staff members were hired to help as well. Closing down the resort during peaks in demand is not a good idea; the resort would lose revenue and would likely struggle to stay in business.

A. differences in staff members' abilities.
B. standardized check-in procedures.
C. perishability of unsold rooms.
D. customer satisfaction surveys.

83. A
Differences in staff members' abilities. Services by nature are highly variable and dependent on who provides them. Some staff members may be more skilled than others, which can cause guests to perceive their experiences differently. The perishability of unsold rooms is an internal financial challenge of a hotel that does not cause variability in its service. Standardized check-in procedures are a technique that hotels use to reduce variability in service. Customer satisfaction surveys are used to evaluate a hotel's service and do not cause variability.

84. C
The customer will generate word-of-mouth influence. When customers request special treatment, honoring their requests will create an exceptional experience for them. They will be much more likely to provide positive wordof-mouth feedback to other potential customers. It is not likely that other customers will feel that they are not being treated fairly, that the customer will become even more demanding, or that the company will be perceived as inadequate.

D. name a few spices that probably are in the soup.

85. B
Offer to check with the cook. Servers should obtain information about menu items from the kitchen staff on an ongoing basis. When patrons have food questions servers cannot answer, the servers should obtain the answers from the kitchen staff. Because customers may have dietary problems, servers should not guess at the contents of food dishes. Truthfulness is essential in dealing with customers, and a little extra consideration can prompt return business.

Accepting mobile credit card payments. Businesses have a lot to consider when deciding whether or not to accept credit card payments—and how to accept credit card payments. Mobile credit cards are increasingly popular with the younger, tech-savvy demographic, so the coffee shop should consider accepting mobile credit card payments.

They have already exhausted their secondary research options. Primary research is that which a person or company generates on their own for their exact needs and purposes. Primary research is generally done when the needed information does not exist yet. Therefore, the airline executive should first do an exhaustive search of secondary sources before deciding to conduct primary research. Even if no one on the executive's team has the information they need, the executive still might not need to conduct primary research because they might be able to use secondary research. If the airline has little money for research, the executive might be better off focusing on secondary research because it is cheaper than primary research.

Unauthorized individuals found on the scene. The presence of unauthorized people is a threat to the security of patrons, employees, and to the hospitality and tourism business. Individuals responsible for security will need to quickly determine the reason that the unauthorized people are present. Spilled water and a choking patron are safety threats.

A. are environmentally sustainable.
B. have high value in the market.

Have high value in the market. To identify its competitive advantage, a business must consider what makes its service, product, capability, or other resource superior to all of a customer's other choices—in other words, what gives that service, product, capability, or resource greater value in the market. Commonplace capabilities and resources are not likely to result in a competitive advantage. While a business can benefit from environmentally sustainable capabilities and resources, sustainability is not likely to result in a competitive advantage if those capabilities and resources lack value. When a capability or resource is difficult to maintain, the cost for its upkeep is likely to outweigh any benefit it provides.

97. The primary purpose of environmental law is to 
A. encourage business development.
B. safeguard business structures.
C. maintain competition in the marketplace.
D. protect natural resources.

97. D
Protect natural resources. The primary purpose of environmental regulations is to protect natural resources, including the air, soil, and water. Environmental laws require businesses to control the amount and type of pollution they release into the environment and to use appropriate measures for the disposal of hazardous waste. By following environmental regulations, businesses are complying with the government's efforts to protect natural resources by keeping air, soil, and water safe for consumption.

98. Why should service employees always collect a coupon from customers rather than just keying the discount into the register? 
A. The employer can be reimbursed double the amount on the coupon instead of at face value.
B. It speeds up the amount of time that it takes to complete the transaction.
C. Customers will likely become upset if the coupon is not taken from them.
D. The coupon provides evidence that the service was provided.

98. D
The coupon provides evidence that the service was provided. A coupon serves as a physical record that a discount was provided when the customer paid for the service. This is especially important when a service marketer needs to be reimbursed by the appropriate party for the amount on the coupon. Service marketers that choose to double the value of coupons must make up the difference between the face value printed on the coupon and the doubled amount. Customers do not get mad when their coupons are not taken from them because it offers them another opportunity to enjoy a discounted price. If anything, accepting a coupon would slightly slow down the transaction time because the discount must be entered into the register; however, the amount of time is negligible.
