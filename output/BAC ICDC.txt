1. According to the law of diminishing returns, if one input increases while all others are constant, the increases in output will 
A. remain the same.
B. eventually decline.
C. continue to increase.
D. decline before increasing.

1. B
Eventually decline. The law of diminishing returns is an economic concept that states that if one input increases while all others are constant, at some point the increases in output will decline. The law of diminishing returns (also sometimes referred to as the law of diminishing marginal returns or the law of variable proportions) does not state that if one input increases while all others are constant, the increases in output will continue to increase, remain the same, or decline before increasing.

2. Which of the following statements about a private corporation is true: 
A. It does not offer shares to the general public.
B. It has a specific mission other than making a profit.
C. It can sell unlimited shares to the general public.
D. It is limited to 100 or fewer shareholders.

2. A
It does not offer shares to the general public. A private corporation, also known as a close corporation, is a type of corporation owned by a few people that does not offer its shares for sale to the general public. A "C" corporation, also known as a public corporation, can sell unlimited shares of stock to the general public— meaning there may be unlimited stockholders in just one company. A subchapter corporation, or "S" corporation, is a type of corporation that is limited to 100 or fewer shareholders, has limited shareholder liability, and requires little financial reporting. A nonprofit organization operates to accomplish a specific mission—other than to make a profit. Generally, the purpose of the organization is to help society, and income is used to fund programs and cover operational expenses.

3. X-ray machines, surgical equipment, wheelchairs, and scrubs are all items that a hospital might buy for 
A. resale.
B. negotiations.
C. business use.
D. production.

3. C
Business use. A hospital is a business that purchases many goods and services for its own use rather than resale or transformation. Without the necessary equipment, furniture, medicine, and supplies, the hospital could not properly care for its patients. These items would not be purchased for production, negotiations, or resale.

4. Support staff positions typically fall within the __________ area of business management careers. 
A. business information management
B. administrative services
C. accounting
D. human resources management

4. B
Administrative services. Business management careers include positions in the areas of administrative services, business information management, general management, human resource management, and operations management. Employees working in administrative services facilitate business operations through a variety of administrative and clerical duties, including information and communication management, data processing and collection, and project tracking. These positions are often referred to as support staff positions. For example, an executive or administrative assistant may support the company president by managing their schedule and answering their phone calls, or a customer service representative may support the company by processing incoming orders and handling customer requests and complaints.

5. An effective way to evaluate a risk is to determine 
A. inventory and probability.
B. objections and inventory.
C. probability and magnitude.
D. magnitude and body language.

5. C
Probability and magnitude. Probability is the likelihood of an event occurring while magnitude is the seriousness or extent of an event’s impact. Combining these two factors can help someone analyze possible risks when making a decision. Body language includes gestures, facial expressions, or other nonverbal forms of communication. Body language is rarely an effective way to evaluate risk. Inventory is the stock of goods a business possesses and is not directly related to determining risk.

A. improve his reading skills.
B. interrupt the speaker.
C. avoid asking questions.
D. use nonverbal cues.

6. D
Use nonverbal cues. Active listening is a method of listening that involves paying attention, displaying proof of listening, and providing feedback to facilitate the two-way transmission of information. It uses nonverbal cues, paraphrasing, questioning, and other techniques to let a speaker know that a message has been heard and understood. If Jamie wants to improve his active listening skills, he should ask questions to demonstrate he is listening. Jamie should not interrupt the speaker. Improving reading skills does not necessarily improve listening skills.

7. Which of the following is a disadvantage of specialization: 
A. Boredom may increase on the job
B. Worker dependency decreases
C. Worker training is simplified
D. Quantity of work increases

7. A
Boredom may increase on the job. Specialization is the process of using an employee’s narrow focus on one task or area of expertise in the production of goods and services. A disadvantage of specialization is that it may increase boredom on the job. In some areas of specialization, especially those involving mass production and assembly lines, repetition of the same task can cause employees to become bored and uninterested in their work. When this happens, productivity, employee satisfaction, and product quality may decrease, causing problems for the company. Another disadvantage of specialization is that worker dependency increases (rather than decreases). Simplified worker training is an advantage of specialization. Although specialization can increase the quality of work, it does not necessarily mean the quantity of work increases.

A. encrypted.
B. accurate.
C. interesting.
D. positive.

8. B
Accurate. To make business decisions, companies access, store, maintain, and evaluate a variety of information. To make appropriate decisions, companies need to make sure the information that they are basing their decisions upon is accurate and relevant. Encryption is the process of transforming information into a secret code so that only the recipient can read it. Not all information needs to be encrypted. While positive and interesting information about the company is useful, it is more important that the information is honest and accurate.

A. It can be costly to implement.
B. It encourages flexibility.
C. It discourages flexibility.
D. It reduces organizational unity.

12. A
It can be costly to implement. Since both department managers and team managers require higher compensation, a matrix structure is typically more expensive to implement than other structures. A matrix structure promotes unity; a reduction of organizational unity is a disadvantage of the divisional structure. A matrix structure encourages flexibility rather than discouraging it. However, this is an advantage of the matrix structure, not a disadvantage.

Positive reinforcement. Teammates who treat each other with respect and encouragement are likely to be more engaged in a shared vision. Positivity keeps people going when challenges arise. Criticism is not as likely to motivate engagement in a shared vision. Creativity is often the result of a shared vision, rather than a motivation for it.

15. D
Take small, manageable steps to close the gap. If you discover your values and behavior do not match up, you should take small, manageable steps to close the gap. Try to set a goal for yourself, such as taking one action per week that would support your personal values. You should not radically change your life to quickly adjust course. You should adjust your behavior instead of changing your values to include everything. It’s better to take small steps than to wait to observe how this impacts your life.

Improve production by 10%. A goal is a statement that clearly describes a task to be accomplished. Some goals are general, and some are specific. Often, when businesses create general goals, they then create smaller, more specific goals that can be used to measure progress along the way. An example of a specific goal is to improve production by 10%. Increasing sales, decreasing prices, and improving employee morale are examples of general goals.

Export. Export laws regulate goods that are sent outside of a country to another nation. Therefore, if an organization is shipping goods internationally, it should be aware of export laws to avoid penalties and fines. Import laws regulate goods that are sent into a country by other countries. Civil laws deal with rights and duties of private entities, as well as possible disputes between them. Criminal laws deal with crime and the legal punishment of criminal offenses.

22. A contract is considered legally binding if 
A. the subject of the contract is ambiguous.
B. something of value is exchanged between parties.
C. only one party agrees on the offer.
D. at least one party is a business.

22. B
Something of value is exchanged between parties. A legally binding contract is any agreement that is legally enforceable by a court. In other words, if you sign a legally binding contract and don't fulfill your end of the bargain as promised in the contract, then the other party can take you to court. For a contract to be legally binding, something of value must be exchanged for something else of value. This can include money, goods, services, and promises. Both parties must agree to the offer, terms, and conditions of a contract for it to be legally binding. The subject of a legally binding contract must be clearly and unambiguously defined in the document to ensure that all parties understand what is being agreed upon. The parties in a legally binding contract can be a person or an entity (such as a business). There’s no requirement that a legally binding contract needs to include at least one business.

23. A
Balance sheet. A balance sheet is a financial statement that captures the financial condition of the business at that particular moment by evaluating assets and liabilities. It is crucial to understanding a business’ overall performance and would be incredibly useful when making financial decisions. Personal checks and pay stubs are pieces of personal financial information that would be useful to an individual, but not a business when making financial decisions. Company bylaws can help a business govern itself, but not make financial decisions.

An oven purchased by a bakery owner. Industrial goods are used to make other products for resale or used in the day-to-day operations of a business. An oven purchased by a bakery owner is an output that is considered an industrial good. Consumer goods are ultimately purchased by consumers. A family’s set of measuring cups, a college student’s mixer, and a roll of cookie dough intended for home use are all examples of consumer goods.

25. What is a valid reason for evaluating project success? 
A. To reduce monthly expenditures
B. To conduct employee reviews
C. To identify needs for future projects
D. To bypass stakeholder feedback

25. C
To identify needs for future projects. After evaluating your project results, you might find that your project did not solve all of the problems that it intended to solve. In this case, you might need to start a new project to resolve the remaining issues. Evaluating a project's success is not intended as a means to bypass stakeholder feedback. In fact, sharing lessons learned with stakeholders is an important part of project evaluation. Evaluating project success does not necessarily mean that monthly expenses will be reduced. Employee evaluations are not an integral aspect of evaluating project success.

He assumes all of his customers will be just like the Asian-American customers he worked with in the United States. What is Kaiden guilty of? 
A. Jargon
B. Individualism
C. Stereotyping
D. Ethnocentrism

26. C
Stereotyping. Stereotyping involves generalizing people based on their cultural backgrounds. Kaiden is stereotyping his potential new customers by generalizing them based on their cultural background. Kaiden's customers in Asia will almost certainly not be just like his Asian-American customers from the U.S. Ethnocentrism is the belief that your own culture is naturally better than other cultures. Individualism is an emphasis on independent work and accomplishments, as those in an individualist society have loose group ties and are expected to take care of themselves. Jargon is specialized language known only to a certain group of people.

27. When practicing time management, you should focus on tasks that are 
A. collaborative and straightforward.
B. straightforward and important.
C. urgent and collaborative.
D. important and urgent.

27. D
Important and urgent. A key principle of time management is to determine which tasks are important and urgent. Not all tasks are the same. Some can be categorized as important, which means they are essential for achieving your goals. Urgent tasks are those that demand immediate attention. An urgent task isn’t necessarily important, and important tasks are not necessarily urgent. For example, answering a phone call is urgent because if you don’t pick up right away, you’ll miss the call. However, that phone call might be from a telemarketer who is selling a product that you have no interest in. Also, some tasks are neither important nor urgent, such as redesigning your email signature or reading a funny article that a friend posted online. These types of tasks should be limited or avoided if possible because they won’t lead to any results. Collaborative and straightforward tasks may or may not be important or urgent.

A. Focus group
B. To-do list
C. Flow chart
D. Survey

28. C
Flow chart. A flow chart is used to analyze a sequence of events and uncover its relationships. Flow charts help you schedule your project, figure out the order of work that you’ll need to complete, connect activities to one another, and help you visualize the project work. A survey is a marketing research method used to gather useful data and information from individuals; it involves asking consumers questions to learn their opinions and the reasons behind those opinions. A focus group is a group formed to discuss a specific topic. A to-do list is a list of activities that an individual plans to accomplish during a certain period of time. A to-do list may be helpful to the project manager, but it won't help them connect activities to one another.

Skills assessment. How do you choose who will do what in a project? A skills assessment helps you figure out what skills and experiences would allow someone to be successful for each task.

Bottom-up estimation, a social media platform, and a community sponsor will not help you determine which person should be responsible for what project task.

Then, they identify methods of achieving those goals and the resources required to carry out the plans. They also set dates for completing tasks and projects. As the manager of an ice-cream shop, for instance, you might set a goal of increasing sales. You might then decide to increase advertising to help achieve that goal. Planning is important because it lays the groundwork for all of the other management functions.

Possession. Possession utility is usefulness created when ownership of a product is transferred from the seller to the buyer. A discounted price of a product allows a consumer to take possession of an item without having to pay full price. Place utility is usefulness created by making sure that goods and services are available at the place where they are needed or wanted by customers. Form utility is usefulness created by altering or changing the form or shape of a good or service to make it more useful to the consumer. Time utility is usefulness created when products are made available at the time they are needed or wanted by consumers.

33. A
When you are experiencing success. When things are going well, change doesn’t always seem necessary. This can lead to missed opportunities. If you are challenging the status quo, you have likely already identified a need to improve or change. Being in a leadership position does not necessarily mean you will overlook the need for change or improvement. In fact, a quality of a good leader is having the courage to suggest or implement change. When you are using critical thinking skills, you would most likely notice the need for improvement or change rather than overlook it.

Communicated the rules more clearly. Ethics aren’t always black and white, and sometimes it can be challenging to know what to do or what is expected. Peter should have communicated his expectations and clearly explained how employees were supposed to use their company laptops. Enforcing stricter punishments and relaxing the computer policies would not necessarily help in this situation. There is no indication that Peter needs to hire more ethical employees. His current employees are not necessarily unethical; rather, they did not understand how to behave ethically due to a lack of communication.

Inform. Different oral presentations have different purposes, such as to inform, to persuade, and to entertain. When speakers share knowledge or skills, their purpose is to inform. Teachers and coaches are two professions that often give informative presentations. When speakers share knowledge or skills, their purpose is not to persuade, entertain, or boast. Speakers use persuasion in a presentation to challenge others to consider and accept new ideas or to take action. Entertaining speeches, given to amuse or inspire, usually occur at special events like weddings or award ceremonies. The purpose of oral presentations is typically not to boast.

39. Mercedes recently quit her job so that she could attend college. Mercedes is experiencing what type of unemployment? 
A. Structural
B. Frictional
C. Seasonal
D. Technological

39. B
Frictional. Frictional unemployment is voluntary unemployment that results from normal life circumstances. It can occur when a person transitions between jobs, quits their job to go back to college, or moves to a new city to look for better job opportunities. Structural unemployment is unemployment that arises when there is a mismatch between available workers and available jobs. This doesn’t simply mean that there are fewer jobs than there are workers, although that could be true. It might also mean that there are not enough workers qualified for the types of jobs that are available. Seasonal unemployment is a type of structural unemployment that affects seasonal employees, such as farm workers, lifeguards, ski-resort employees, tax-return preparers, and teachers. Technological unemployment is a type of structural unemployment that occurs when advances in technology eliminate certain job positions.

Spreadsheet. A spreadsheet is a type of software used to organize, calculate, and analyze numerical data. Because spreadsheets can help organize and synthesize large amounts of information, they are especially useful in accounting. The internet would not be a useful or reliable source of information for an internal accounting process. A word processor is used to create text documents. A GPS (Global Positioning System) is useful for tracking the physical location of something and is not useful for financial information.

A. Be a leader and encourage feedback
B. Be patient and persistent
C. Reward yourself for your accomplishments
D. Take a break to refresh your mind

42. C
Reward yourself for your accomplishments. By inviting his team members to celebrate at a nearby restaurant after work, Ian is rewarding himself and his team for finishing their six-month project. This will help Ian and his team to stay motivated and to continue working hard to achieve their goals. This does not necessarily demonstrate being a leader or being patient and persistent. Encouraging feedback and taking a break to refresh your mind are not steps in developing an achievement orientation.

A. Labor relations
B. Competition
C. Human errors
D. Property damage

44. B
Competition. Strategic risks can have significant impact on the company’s long-term plans. Strategic risks often concern the overall business environment, economic or political issues, or the company’s objectives. Some types include competition, reputation damage, regulatory and political issues, and changing customer needs or demographics. Human errors and labor relations are operational risks—the possible events and situations that can result from employee actions, core processes, and daily business activities. Property damage is a hazard risk—potential events or situations that can cause injury or harm to people, property, or the environment.

A. make it long and detailed.
B. sign your name.
C. avoid using bullet points.
D. speak to your audience.

46. D
Speak to your audience. The executive summary is the most important part of a company’s business or marketing plan because it gives an overview of the entire document. Executive summaries are often used to determine whether it is worthwhile to read any further, as they are essentially short, concise, informative, and easy-to-read opening statements for a business plan. When writing an executive summary for a business plan, it is important to speak to your audience. Personalizing the executive summary to the interests of the audience will make it easier to capture the audience’s attention. Rather than making the executive summary long and detailed, it should be short and concise while highlighting the main points of the business plan. Using bullet points is a great way to make an executive summary more readable. It is not typical to sign your name after writing an executive summary for a business plan.

Leave-me-alone. A leave-me-alone customer is a customer who prefers or pretends to prefer to be left alone to find what they want. Even if they are offered assistance or advice, leave-me-alone customers turn it away. Argumentative customers are customers who seem to disagree, question, or look for error in almost everything and everybody. Complaining customers are customers who believe everything is going wrong for them and everybody is either taking advantage of them or not really trying to help. Impatient customers are customers who feel they must be helped immediately, regardless of the circumstances.

A. conducting a performance review.
B. partnering with likeminded organizations.
C. avoiding a potential conflict of interest.
D. prioritizing short-term goals.

50. C
Avoiding a potential conflict of interest. A conflict of interest is a situation in which it is impossible to be truly impartial. If Melanie were to conduct business with an organization that she has personal ties to, there is a potential conflict of interest between her duty as an accountant and an incentive to help the company. Melanie is not partnering with any organization or conducting a performance review in this example. Prioritizing short term goals is not always ethical behavior—Melanie is thinking in the long term by avoiding conflicts of interest.

A. Avoid scanning titles and headings
B. Dive right into reading
C. Memorize key terms and concepts
D. Control her reading environment

54. D
Control her reading environment. To improve her reading skills, it is important for Maya to control her reading environment. By considering where and when she reads, she will give herself the best chance of reading effectively. Somewhere quiet, comfortable, and free of distractions with optimal lighting is ideal for most people to read effectively. Rather than diving right into reading, Maya should prepare herself to get the most out of her reading. This can be done by scanning titles and headings, as it can help her understand the basics of the content. Although understanding key terms and concepts is important, memorizing them won't necessarily help Maya improve her reading skills.

Balance sheet. A balance sheet captures the financial condition of the business at that particular moment. This financial report contains the company's assets: that which it owns, such as merchandise inventory; liabilities: that which it owes, such as accounts payable (the monies owed to vendors); and its total equity. The profit-andloss statement is a summary of business transactions that shows net profit before and after taxes. A tax return is a form used to report an individual’s or organization’s tax returns.

C. mixed costs.
D. an economy of scale.

59. C
Mixed costs. Some operating costs may be considered partially variable and partially fixed. These are known as semi-variable costs (sometimes called semi-fixed costs or mixed costs). Semi-variable costs are fixed until the company reaches a certain level of production; after that, they become variable. For example, a manufacturer has a fixed cost for its employees’ wages, but when it decides to produce a greater number of products this month, its employees work more hours and earn overtime. The employees’ base wages are still fixed, but the cost of paying this overtime is variable, depending on how many extra hours are worked.

60. C
Corporate social responsibility. Corporate social responsibility is an increasingly popular strategy for attracting ethics-minded customers. It involves donating a portion of profits to charity, sponsoring health and wellness initiatives, or giving back to the community in other ways. Competition is a rivalry between two or more businesses competing for customers. While the car dealership may be engaging in competition, hosting fundraisers and donating to local organizations does not necessarily point to competition with other firms. Systematic random sampling is a probability sampling method in which researchers place sampling units into a random list. Technical analysis is a marketing process using historical information from market activity, prices, and volume to evaluate securities and predict future price activity.

C. Good intentions with data analysis ensure a positive outcome.
D. Companies must exercise transparency when collecting, storing, and using data.

64. D
Companies must exercise transparency when collecting, storing, and using data. Data mining is the process of searching, collecting, and analyzing large amounts of data to extract actionable information. Companies that are ethical with their data mining practices exercise transparency when collecting, storing, and using data. Simply, customers know how companies plan to collect, store, and use their information. Before data is collected, customers must consent to it. It is unethical to collect someone's personal data without their consent. Companies that are ethical ensure the privacy of the data they collect. Even if a customer consents for their personal information to be collected, stored, and analyzed, that doesn't mean they want it made available publicly. Ethical data mining practices ensure the privacy of customer information. Even when intentions with data analysis are good, inadvertent harm to individuals or groups of people is still possible. Companies can't know for certain the impact of their data analysis until it is complete. However, ethical data mining practices help companies consider this question beforehand and can help them catch any potential occurrences of disparate impact.

D. Fishbone diagram

65. D
Fishbone diagram. A fishbone diagram, also called a cause-and-effect diagram or an Ishikawa diagram, is a way to identify many potential causes of a problem and sort them into useful categories. It is especially useful in group settings or when there is little “hard” information to go on. A check sheet, or tally sheet, is simply a form for collecting data on the spot. A histogram is a graph with touching bars that show the distribution of a variable and cannot be rearranged; it is used to visually represent information. A house of quality matrix is used during the production-planning process to determine if a product meets customer needs. While they are important tools, check sheets, histograms, and house of quality matrices would not be most useful in this scenario.

The guidelines that companies set for their employees are as diverse as the business world itself—but there are several types of policies and procedures that nearly every company implements. Many companies have policies regarding the use of the internet during work hours. Most internet policies explain that employees should use the internet appropriately and responsibly. For example, a company may restrict employee access to only websites that are required for work. Or, a company may simply say that employees cannot use personal social media websites during work hours. Companies typically have health and safety, disciplinary, and discrimination policies, but they are unrelated to employee website access.

When Anita asks Peyton about it, Peyton sidesteps the question and tells Anita to forget what happened. In this instance, would it be okay for Anita to bypass Peyton and inform the human resources manager of Peyton's actions? 
A. No, because Anita should listen to Peyton and forget what happened.
B. Yes, because Peyton engaged in an illegal activity.
C. Yes, because Anita should always bypass Peyton in the chain of command.
D. No, because Peyton did not do anything wrong.

67. B
Yes, because Peyton engaged in an illegal activity. Despite the importance of following your company’s chain of command, there are several situations in which it’s okay—and required—to bypass it. If you witness your boss participating in an unethical or illegal activity, you should tell your company’s human resources manager. In this scenario, Peyton stealing money from the cash register is illegal, while Peyton telling Anita to forget what she saw is unethical. As a result, Anita should tell the human resources manager about Peyton's actions. Although Anita should bypass Peyton on the chain of command in this instance, she should not do so on a regular basis. In most cases, Anita should report to Peyton and should listen to what they say. Because Peyton's actions were wrong, illegal, and unethical, Anita should not listen to Peyton and should not forget what happened.

Keep in mind that growth and development aren’t always easy but are necessary for success. Then, use the feedback to your advantage as you continue to assess your strengths and weaknesses. Receiving compensation is not a way to identify strengths and weaknesses. Compliments are nice, but they are not always helpful in assessing strengths and weaknesses.

Respect involves honoring the rights, freedoms, views, and property of others. Accountability means accepting responsibility for one’s decisions. Quality is a measure of project excellence. While respect, accountability, and quality are important, the project leaders are not necessarily demonstrating these principles in this example.

73. The government prevents a single business from controlling the entire production of a good or service. This is an example of how government involvement can 
A. provide public goods.
B. regulate workplace conditions.
C. conserve the environment.
D. protect competition.

73. D
Protect competition. Government tries to promote free competition for business by banning or regulating monopolies (when a single business influences the entire production of a particular good or service). Since a monopoly eliminates any major competitors, the monopoly can control the price of the product by restricting production. The regulation or banning of monopolies is how the government promotes and protects competition. This is not an example of how government involvement can regulate workplace conditions, conserve the environment, or provide public goods.

74. Rosemary always remembers to hold the door open for the person behind her, because she has learned the impact her small actions can have on others. What trait is Rosemary demonstrating? 
A. Acceptance
B. Sympathy
C. Empathy
D. Self-awareness

74. D
Self-awareness. Self-awareness is understanding the influence and effect you have on others. Self-aware people don’t make choices without considering the impact those choices will have on other people. Selfawareness can be demonstrated in small ways, such as holding the door open for the person behind you or cleaning the microwave after you use it. Empathy is the ability to relate to the feelings, thoughts, and experiences of other people. Sympathy is the ability to recognize another person’s feelings. Acceptance is the approval or tolerance of all people, regardless of their behavior or performance.

75. Which of the following statements about building positive customer relationships is true: 
A. Businesses should aim to simply meet customer expectations.
B. Businesses must be reactive to customer feedback.
C. Customer relations do not impact competition.
D. Positive customer relations encourage customer loyalty.

75. D
Positive customer relations encourage customer loyalty. Positive customer relations encourage repeat business and customer loyalty. When customers feel that a business has taken the time and effort to build relationships with them, they are much less likely to switch over to a competitor, even if the competitor lowers its prices. Over time, these long-term customers can spend a lot of money with the business, making its customer relations efforts pay off for years to come. Customer relations do impact competition. For example, if a customer has a poor relationship with a business, they may turn to a competing business. To build positive customer relations, businesses must be proactive. Reacting to questions, complaints, and problems as they occur is not enough. Businesses must stay ahead of these issues, striving to keep problems from happening in the first place, as well as striving to provide positive customer experiences with every interaction. Businesses should not settle for meeting customer expectations; rather, they should look to exceed them.

A. Higher quality products at cheaper prices
B. Customers do more shopping outside business hours
C. Vendors offer competitive discounts on supplies
D. Employees performing their jobs more efficiently

79. D
Employees performing their jobs more efficiently. Customer relationship management (CRM) refers to the strategies, processes, technology, and people a business uses to build, maintain, and maximize the long-term value of customer relationships. There are several benefits of implementing a well-planned CRM program, including that it allows employees to perform their jobs more efficiently, an increase in word-of-mouth promotion, increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, and increased sales and profits. Higher quality products at cheaper prices, customers doing more shopping outside business hours, and vendors offering competitive discounts on supplies are not common results of a company effectively implementing a CRM program.

80. Which of the following is an effective way to defend ideas objectively: 
A. Prepare ahead of time
B. Limit audience feedback
C. Avoid thanking critics
D. Respond with opinions

80. A
Prepare ahead of time. An effective way to defend ideas objectively is to prepare ahead of time. Whenever you present an idea, there's always a chance someone doesn't understand or agree with your idea. Because of this, it is important to prepare yourself for objections by considering how someone might respond and why, and developing counter arguments to address concerns. When defending ideas objectively, it is important to willingly accept feedback, thank critics for their thoughts, and to respond with facts rather than opinions.

A. avoid asking questions.
B. listen passively.
C. rely on your memory.
D. respond with a good attitude.

81. D
Respond with a good attitude. To effectively follow directions in the workplace, it is important to respond with a good attitude. It is important to demonstrate respect and a good attitude when your manager or supervisor gives you instructions. Demonstrating a bad attitude will not only make it more difficult to the person giving directions, but it will also likely make the task you're performing more difficult. Asking questions, actively listening, and taking notes (rather than relying on your memory) are important steps you can take to effectively follow directions in the workplace.

82. Which of the following best describes a market economic system: 
A. Prices are set by the government.
B. Individuals and businesses own the means of production.
C. The government owns and controls all means of production.
D. It is sometimes called a subsistence system.

82. B
Individuals and businesses own the means of production. A market economy is an economic system in which the questions of what, how, and for whom products will be produced are answered by individuals and businesses in the marketplace. Therefore, in a market economic system, individuals and businesses own the means of production and distribution. In a market economic system, prices are controlled by supply and demand rather than being set by the government. In communist command economies, the government owns and controls practically all of the means of production and distribution. A traditional economic system is sometimes called a subsistence system. Subsistence is a level of existence that barely supports life. People in a traditional system consume all that they produce to satisfy their basic needs for food and shelter.

83. Which of the following is considered a rich form of communication: 
A. Blog
B. Video conference
C. Voice message
D. Email

83. B
Video conference. Communication channels differ on a scale from rich to lean. Rich channels are channels that offer more interaction, provide opportunities for two-way communication, and allow both the sender and receiver to read nonverbal messages. Examples of rich channels of communication include face-to-face meetings, video conferences, and in-person oral presentations. Lean channels present information without allowing for immediate interaction. Examples of lean channels of communication include voice messages, blogs, emails, newsletters, texts, and social media posts.

A. They require more decision-making.
B. They follow fewer laws.
C. They are more flexible.
D. They have more money to invest.

89. C
They are more flexible. Most small businesses are started by people who are pursuing a passion or trying to fill a market niche. These people probably wouldn’t have started their own businesses if they didn’t have big ideas! Small businesses have more flexibility to pursue those ideas. They often do not have to stick to rigid schedules or follow a predetermined set of rules. They have the freedom to do the work they want to do, and that freedom can lead to innovation. Huge corporations tend to have more money to invest and require more decision-making before proceeding with plans. Any size company is expected to follow appropriate laws and regulations.

Increased retention of top talent. Businesses with collaborative work environments can attract top talent and are more likely to retain it as well. High-performing individuals seek opportunities to engage with others and increase their knowledge and skills. When employees are engaged at work, they experience more job satisfaction and are likely to stay on board for the long term. Personal and professional growth, as well as greater job satisfaction, are benefits employees experience from collaboration.

A. Subordination
B. Coordination
C. Division
D. Parallelism

92. B
Coordination. When creating an outline, coordination means ensuring all the information in the first heading should have the same significance as the information in the second heading. This also applies to subheadings. For example, if the first heading is “Benefits of creating an outline,” the second heading should follow the same format, such as “Disadvantages of creating an outline.” Parallelism refers to headings having a parallel structure (e.g., if the first heading is a verb, the second heading should be a verb). Subordination refers to information in headings being more general, while information in subheadings should be more specific. Division refers to each heading being divided into two or more parts.

A. Attend religious seminary
B. Get accepted to medical school
C. Write a best-selling novel
D. Graduate from law school

93. B
Get accepted to medical school. Having a personal vision allows you to set goals that fully align with your ultimate ambitions, making seemingly tough decisions much easier. For example, if your personal vision involves working to cure cancer, an appropriate goal would be to get accepted to medical school. You wouldn’t make it your goal to get accepted to law school or religious seminary, because those goals do not align with your personal vision. Writing a best-selling novel also does not align with working to cure cancer. As you can see, having a personal vision ensures that you are spending your time and efforts on pursuits that are truly important to you.

Persistent. Even though he wants to give up, Marco continues working through his trigonometry homework problems—Marco is being persistent. Persistence is the ability to continue working on a task or idea until the desired outcome is achieved. Altruism is the principle of concern for others’ welfare. Respect is regard or esteem and involves honoring the rights, freedoms, views, and property of others.

Shrinking product life cycles. A product’s life cycle refers to the stages it moves through from the time it is introduced to the market until the time it is taken off the market. Because of the rapid innovation now taking place in the worlds of business and technology, product life cycles have become shorter. Outsourcing involves acquiring assistance from outside organizations/consultants to obtain goods or services to accomplish business objectives or perform primary business activities. E-commerce is the buying and selling of goods online. Microscopic globalization is a fictitious term.

97. D
Become an expert in a new graphic design software. As a specific target, a goal can be a performance goal or a learning goal. If you’re evaluated on how well you do something (e.g., completing a manuscript on time, receiving a high performance review score, delivering a presentation without mistakes), you’re judged on your level of performance. A learning goal, on the other hand, has to do with mastering a new skill. For example, a graphic designer might decide they want to go on to learn a new software thoroughly and become an expert at using it. This is a learning goal they’ve set for themselves, and they’ll have completed it when they feel completely comfortable using the software.

Maintain an open line of communication. When editing a document with someone else, it is important to maintain an open line of communication. This can include talking with your co-editor over a video call, phone call, or online chat. When editing a document with someone else, you should be sure to use track changes, as it will show the other author the changes you made and give them an opportunity to easily review them. Coeditors should be sure to use the same software when editing, such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs. This will allow for real-time collaboration and version control. While co-editors certainly can review the document at different times, reviewing at the same time (and using the same software) allows for better collaboration.
