1. Which of the following is an example of a personal liability: 
A. Mutual funds
B. Mortgage
C. Treasury bills
D. Vacation home

1. B
Mortgage. Personal liabilities are any debts that an individual owes. A mortgage is a loan used to purchase real estate. A person who takes out a mortgage owes a certain amount to the lender that must be paid back over time. Therefore, a mortgage is a personal liability. A vacation home, mutual funds, and treasury bills are all examples of personal assets, which are anything of value that a person owns that can be converted into cash.

2. Why is it important for businesses to follow local health ordinances? 
A. To lower the need for medical care facilities
B. To protect the natural environment
C. To reduce the risk of widespread illness
D. To prevent accidents in the workplace

2. C
To reduce the risk of widespread illness. The purpose of health regulations is to protect the population from widespread illnesses. Depending on the industry or business type, most localities require businesses to follow certain rules to reduce the risk of illness. For example, various levels of government are likely to require that restaurants handle, store, and cook foods in certain ways to prevent illnesses such as e coli. Safety regulations intend to reduce the risk of accidents. The purpose of environmental regulations is to protect the natural environment from such issues as air pollution and waste management. Following health ordinances does not lower a community's need for medical care facilities.

3. The time value of money says a dollar you receive in the future will be worth less than a dollar received today due to 
A. interest.
B. exchange rates.
C. disposable income.
D. inflation.

3. D
Inflation. The concept of the time value of money is based on the belief that inflation will always rise—the price of goods will increase over time. The time value of money concept is not based on the belief that interest will always rise, although the concept encourages people to grow their funds through the advantage of interest. The time value of money deals with a specific currency and does not consider exchange rates for other currencies. Disposable income refers to earned income left after taxes owed are paid and has no impact on the future value of a dollar.

A. routine
B. extensive
C. limited
D. unlimited

Extensive. There are different types of decisions. You can make routine decisions—the ones you hardly have to think about, such as whether you should wear a clean T-shirt. You can make limited decisions—the ones that require a little time to look at each alternative, such as whether you should sign up for the drama club or flag football. And, you can make extensive decisions—the ones that demand a lot of careful consideration, such as what career you would like to begin to prepare for. Kayla's decision to major in biology was probably the result of lots of research, discussion, and planning—in other words, it was probably an extensive decision.

10. An advantage to a business that uses intranet capabilities is that it allows employees to share the business's information with 
A. former employees.
B. each other.
C. customers.
D. competitors.

10. B
Each other. An intranet is an internal network of computers within an organization that allows employees to access and share information. Intranet systems benefit businesses because employees can view, transmit, and share information across departments, divisions, or branches. For example, an intranet may allow sales staff, purchasing staff, and warehouse staff to view the inventory status of the business's products simultaneously. This is important because each department works with the business's products in different ways. The intranet system allows each department to monitor the business's inventory levels to perform the work. The intranet provides employees access to the same information at any given time, and helps the business run efficiently. Intranet systems often contain confidential information and are not shared with competitors, customers, and former employees.

Enunciate clearly. Enunciating clearly involves speaking clearly and distinctly, which makes the message easy for the listener to follow. The message may not be clear if employees mumble or speak rapidly. It is sometimes useful to have notes when speaking on the phone, but it is not always necessary. Other guidelines to follow are to use appropriate vocabulary and to avoid using an excessive amount of "filler" words, such as "um" and "uh." Filler words can be distracting and often indicate that the speaker is unsure about what they are saying.

C. subtract your earned interest from
D. add your debit card transactions to

15. A
Subtract all applicable fees from. The check register is a central location to record and track all of the checks that you write and the amount of money you spend in your checking account. Each month, you receive a bank statement that details your checking account activity. You should reconcile your check register with your bank statement to ensure that they match. This step is important for many reasons. For example, if you forget to enter transactions in your check register, you may overdraw your account and be fined for insufficient funds. When reconciling your check register, you want to make sure that you have subtracted all fees including debit card transactions and ATM withdrawals. You should add the interest earned if your account is set up to earn interest.

26. Because a business spends a lot of money to purchase and maintain office equipment, it expects its employees to 
A. ask others to operate equipment that they do not know how to use.
B. call service personnel when equipment is not working correctly.
C. develop procedures to fix the equipment.
D. use and handle the equipment with care.

26. D
Use and handle the equipment with care. A business expects its employees to carefully handle and use the business's office equipment. Equipment such as printers and computers are expensive investments for the business and can cost a lot of money to maintain and fix. Therefore, the business expects its employees to be careful with the equipment to reduce the risk of equipment breakdowns. Business managers, rather than employees, develop procedures for equipment handling. For example, a business might delegate responsibility to the office manager to contact service vendors when equipment needs to be fixed or maintained. It is not always necessary to call service people when equipment is not working correctly, such as a paper jam in a printer, which can usually be removed carefully by an employee. Employees should receive training to operate basic office equipment so they do not need to interrupt coworkers to ask them to perform simple tasks that they can easily do themselves.

34. Which of the following statements about the importance of emergency funds is true:

B. Emergency funds tend to be cash or highly liquid assets.
C. Emergency funds should be used for vacations or entertainment.
D. Emergency funds should typically be sufficient to pay one month's worth of expenses.

34. B
Emergency funds tend to be cash or highly liquid assets. An emergency fund refers to money stashed away to be used as a financial safety net in a time of financial distress or to meet unexpected expenses. Emergency funds reduce the need to take out a loan or use credit cards, not increase them. Emergency funds should typically be sufficient to pay three to six months' worth of expenses, and some experts suggest even up to a year's worth of expenses. Money in emergency funds should not be used for vacations or entertainment; rather, it should only be used in the case of financial distress or to meet unexpected expenses.

37. Lack of economic growth is a major problem for __________ economic systems. 
A. communist command
B. traditional
C. socialist command
D. market

37. B
Traditional. Members of traditional economies consume everything that they produce, so they are unable to save. Without any savings, they cannot invest in greater production. As a result, they are unable to raise their economic standards. Although communist economies are often behind socialist and market economies in terms of economic development, none of those three types of economies grow as little as traditional systems.

A. Correcting grammatical mistakes
B. Correcting punctuation errors
C. Reading the text backwards
D. Reading the text aloud

40. D
Reading the text aloud. By reading the text aloud, Lana will not only see the text, she will hear it. By hearing the words, Lana can detect missing words and assess the clarity and sequence of the information. Reading text backwards helps detect misspelled words, punctuation errors, and some grammatical errors, but this activity does not help the editor clarify that content is logical and meaningful.

A. passive; assertive
B. informal; formal
C. verbal; nonverbal
D. internal; external

41. B
Informal; formal. Informal communication is communication that is less bound to conventions and is more casual, whereas formal communication is a strategic exchange of information that adheres to conventions. When you are with your friends, you likely use an informal communication style, but when you are talking to your company's CEO, you should use more formal communication. External communication is any contact between an employee and someone outside of the company. Internal communication is communication that occurs inside the workplace. Internal communication would not occur with friends, and external communication would not occur between you and your company's CEO. A passive communication style involves keeping feelings hidden and avoiding conflict. Assertive communication involves sharing opinions and advocating for oneself. Passive and assertive communication styles do not necessarily change based on whether you are talking to your friends or your CEO. Finally, you will likely use verbal and nonverbal communication when communicating with both your CEO and your friends.

Grapevine. Grapevine is an oral communication method in which information is passed around the company but not formally announced or verified. Coworkers frequently discuss company issues and pass on information from one department to another through the grapevine. Employees often obtain information and communicate it to others through the grapevine before management makes an official announcement. Feedback is evaluative information given by supervisors to employees. Network is a system of contacts within and outside the organization. Structured is formal communication.

B. Caleb uses “um” and “like” in his conversations.
C. Keisha texts her supervisor “2 sick 4 work, sry.”
D. Muriel ignores her roommate's text message.

49. D
Muriel ignores her roommate's text message. Receivers often make mistakes when communicating that can prevent the effective transmission of messages. Effective communication requires a two-way connection to work, and receivers create barriers to communication when they don't practice active listening, forget to complete the requested follow-up actions, and fail to respond to a written message. By ignoring her roommate's text message, Muriel is creating a barrier to communication. Caleb using “um” and “like” in his conversations and Keisha texting her supervisor using slang are examples of senders creating barriers to communication.

50. During its 20 years of operation, the Normandy Company has made very few changes to its accounting methods and system. As a result, the company's financial information is likely to be very 
A. conservative.
B. comparable.
C. consistent.
D. reliable.

50. C
Consistent. Consistent financial information results from the application of similar or identical accounting methods and systems over time within an organization. The Normandy Company has applied very similar accounting methods over its 20 years of operation. Therefore, the company's financial information is likely to be consistent. However, consistent information is not necessarily comparable, reliable, or conservative. There is no way of knowing if the company's accounting methods are similar to those of other businesses in the industry, so the accounting information may not be comparable. Reliable information is accurate and unbiased. The Normandy Company, though, could easily have inaccurate financial information, even though it is consistent. Conservative financial information does not overstate assets and sales or understate liabilities and expenses. There is no indication that the Normandy Company's information is conservative.

Paper forms. Technological innovation is greatly reducing the need for paper forms because much of the information that previously was stored and transmitted on paper is now being sent by computer. Businesses often send emails rather than letters or printed documents. Various types of databases store vast amounts of data that once were housed in file cabinets. Computerized invoices enable businesses to send bills and receive payment without the need for printed forms. As technology continues to advance, the need for paper forms will continue to decrease. Technological innovation has increased the use of skilled workers. Technological innovation has not decreased the use of phone systems for all businesses and has increased the use of electronic mail (email) for most businesses.

B. A question regarding the company's vacation package so Zola can make plans
C. A reinforcement of how Zola's experience can help the company reach its goals
D. A copy of Zola's resume to ensure the employer sees all of her accomplishments

52. C
A reinforcement of how Zola's experience can help the company reach its goals. Thank-you notes and follow-up letters after interviews are good opportunities to clarify or reinforce information with the potential employer. Discussing salary and vacation packages in the follow-up letter is not appropriate; these conversations will likely take place during the interview or after an offer has been made. Including a copy of her resume with the follow-up letter would be redundant, as the interviewer should already have a copy of Zola's resume from her job application or interview.

53. Think about the last time you ate an apple. That apple passed through several hands before it reached your lunch bag. First, the apple was grown by a farmer, who sold it to a wholesaler or distributor, who then sold it to a retail store. Finally, the apple was bought by you or your parents—the final consumers. The apple's journey from farm to table is an example of 
A. supply chain.
B. deflation.
C. marketing.
D. manufacturing.

53. A
Supply chain. A supply chain is a complete network of producers, distributors, and retailers that work together to get a product into the hands of consumers. In this example, the apple journeyed from farmer, to distributor, to retailer, to consumer. This is an example of a supply chain in action—not deflation, manufacturing, or marketing. Deflation is a steady decline in the general price levels of consumer goods and services over a period of time. Manufacturing is the process of changing raw materials so that they will be useful to consumers. Marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers.

C. Martha knocks on the door before entering the meeting room to tell Ryan that his client has arrived.
D. Kevin takes Sarah's stapler off her desk after she tells him it is OK to borrow it for a while.

56. A
John reads the email message on Suzanne's computer screen while she is away from her desk. Successful employees realize the importance of respecting others' privacy in the workplace. When employees respect others' privacy, they are likely to gain the trust and respect of coworkers and managers. Reading a coworker's email without permission is rude and an invasion of privacy. Leaving the room when another person receives a personal telephone call, knocking on the door before entering the room, and asking to borrow an item before taking it are actions that are respectful of others' privacy.

57. Using the accrual method of accounting, calculate the amount of sales that a business would record for one week if it has $12,650 in cash sales, $15,900 in credit sales, and $14,125 cash-on-hand. 
A. $28,550
B. $26,775
C. $30,025
D. $42,675

57. A
$28,550. The accrual method of accounting records transactions at the time they occur even if no money changes hands at that time. This method is used by many businesses, especially those that extend credit. Since credit purchases are never paid for at the time of purchase, the accrual method keeps the business up to date on the amount of sales rather than on the amount of cash received. If a business has cash sales of $12,650 and credit sales of $15,900 in one week, accounting records would show $28,550 in sales for that week even though the money for the credit sales had not yet been received ($12,650 + $15,900 = $28,550). Monthly sales do not include cash-on-hand.

A. Take on more hours per week
B. Obtain a degree in fashion merchandising
C. Get a new job with a different retailer
D. Ask her manager for a pay raise

59. B
Obtain a degree in fashion merchandising. A job is a temporary means to an end that allows you to receive wages and gain experience. On the other hand, a career is a lifelong journey that builds on your skills and experiences, bringing you achievement and satisfaction. A job can be a step on the path to a career. One way that Sammie can advance her job into a career is obtaining a college degree in fashion merchandising, which will allow her to grow and be promoted within the field. Receiving a pay raise is a step in the right direction, but it does not necessarily turn a job into a career. Getting a new job with a different retailer is also not necessarily related to advancing a career. Finally, working more hours is not in and of itself a way to turn a job into a career.

B. A supervisor gives a senior employee a superior evaluation.
C. A new employee suggests changing an established procedure.
D. A manager asks an employee to be a mentor to a new hire.

61. C
A new employee suggests changing an established procedure. Conflicts in business sometimes occur when new employees recommend changing the way that long-time employees have been operating. The long-time employees may resent a new person, who has little experience with the company, making suggestions that imply that the employees are not performing as well as they could. The long-time employees may feel threatened and put up barriers to prevent the new employee from succeeding. In this situation, the new employee and the long-time employees need to discuss the problem and find an acceptable solution. Managers often ask experienced employees to be mentors to new hires. An employee who agrees to work overtime is not creating a problem. An employee's evaluation is confidential and would not create problems with other employees.

64. Nia, the manager of a large group of employees in her company, is responsible for planning the annual holiday party. To determine which toppings her employees like on their pizza, Nia created an online survey for her team to complete with the options cheese, pepperoni, sausage, meat lovers, veggie, and other. She wants to know how many employees prefer each specific topping and compare the totals of each selection. So, she created a graph that represents the totals across two axes. What type of graph did Nia create? 
A. Pie chart
B. Line graph
C. Table
D. Bar graph

64. D
Bar graph. The graph that Nia created is a bar graph. Bar graphs are used to compare absolute values or proportions between different groups or categories, and they represent the data using a series of bars across two axes. Because Nia wants to compare the total number, or absolute value, of employees that chose each topping, a bar graph is the best option for her. A pie chart, a circular graph that displays percentages of a whole as if they were slices of a pie, is best to use when trying to compare parts of a whole. Unlike bar graphs, pie charts can't be used to explicitly show absolute number values for each group. A line graph is similar to a bar graph in that it also shows data across two axes. However, line graphs are typically used to track changes over short and long periods of time. There is not a time element in this scenario. A table displays information in rows and columns, not across two axes.

A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. A sole proprietorship is a type of business ownership in which only one person owns and manages the business. A licensing arrangement is a business structure that requires the authorization or permission from an owner to another entity to use trademarked, copyrighted (e.g., logo, name), or patented material for a specific activity, during a specific time period, for the profit of both parties.

Acquisition of funds. Decisions about financing refer to the acquisition of funds. There are many different ways a business can obtain financing, and there are advantages and disadvantages to each method. Financial managers must decide which method or methods will be most beneficial for the company. Accounts receivable refers to the money owed to the business by others. Administration of assets refers to decisions about investments. Acquisition of funds does not necessarily involve the accounting department.

70. Which of the following is a true statement about emotional intelligence and leadership: 
A. Leaders need to be confident that what they are doing is acceptable.
B. Leaders learn to outlast business fads and trends.
C. Leaders are expected to take action after problems develop.
D. Leaders have to get along with a wide variety of people.

70. D
Leaders have to get along with a wide variety of people. Emotional intelligence and leadership overlap when it comes to proactive behavior, perseverance, positive working relationships, and confidence. To engage in positive working relationships, leaders have to get along with a wide variety of people, sometimes encouraging others and sometimes inspiring them. With proactive behavior, leaders are expected to take action before problems develop. With perseverance, leaders learn to outlast disappointment and fatigue. Learning to outlast business fads and trends is not a part of emotional intelligence, nor is it necessarily a part of leadership. Regarding confidence, leaders need to be confident that what they are doing and saying is right—not (merely) acceptable.

72. Why is it important for individuals to assess their personal strengths and weaknesses? 
A. To be able to respond appropriately in a crisis
B. To be able to negotiate their contracts
C. To get the most bang for their buck
D. To improve their performance

72. D
To improve their performance. Each individual has personal strengths and weaknesses. Assessing strengths will allow an individual to build on those strengths. It is also important to assess weaknesses because those are areas that need improvement. For example, an individual might find that it will be necessary to improve their computer skills to improve performance and be considered for a promotion. It may be difficult to improve performance if individuals have not identified their personal strengths and weaknesses. Assessing personal strengths and weaknesses will not necessarily help individuals respond appropriately in a crisis, negotiate contracts, or get the most bang for their buck.

73. To better understand and follow directions on the job, employees often 
A. practice tasks.
B. review notes.
C. do research.
D. ask questions.

73. D
Ask questions. Before employees can follow directions, they must understand them. Therefore, asking questions is important because supervisors do not always give directions in a clear and concise manner. If employees are not sure of what is expected, they should ask. Taking the time to completely understand the directions will help employees do the work correctly and efficiently. Reviewing notes may not be helpful if employees have written down incorrect directions. Employees are not expected to do the research; researching is the responsibility of supervisors. Before employees can practice tasks, they need accurate directions.

74. What aspect of their employers' codes of conduct are employees violating when they regularly come into work late or leave early? 
A. Safety
B. Appearance
C. Attendance
D. Harassment

74. C
Attendance. To provide a fair and consistent work environment, businesses develop rules of conduct. The rules of conduct outline a company's policies, procedures, and expectations regarding employees' behavior in the workplace. Businesses expect their employees to arrive at work on time and leave work at a designated time. Employees who continuously arrive late not only violate their employers' attendance rules, but cost the companies money for time that the employees are not working. Appearance refers to appropriate dress and hygiene in the workplace. Harassment issues involve saying or doing inappropriate things. Safety violations involve actions that pose harm to employees, coworkers, customers, or visitors.

76. Purchasing's ultimate goal and purpose is always to obtain the right goods and services from the right suppliers at the right price. To reach this goal, purchasing specialists must be sure to 
A. purchase as much as possible when goods are needed.
B. select the supplier with the lowest bid.
C. get the best price from suppliers, even if it damages relationships.
D. locate backup sources of goods and services.

76. D
Locate backup sources of goods and services. It's important for purchasing specialists to be sure they can get the goods and services they need when they need them. It's good to have backup sources because if a purchasing specialist doesn't do their job correctly or get the items or services that the business needs, then the business cannot produce its finished good or service. That could lead the business to lose money or maybe even close. A purchasing specialist doesn't necessarily want to purchase as much as they possibly can; instead, they should purchase in amounts that make sense economically. Getting a good price is important, but a purchasing specialist does not want to do so at the expense of their relationship with the supplier. Although some companies require purchasing specialists to always choose the lowest bidder, buyers are often permitted to select the bidder with the best overall terms, including quality and quantity, even if that supplier's price isn't the lowest.

Short. A characteristic of letters of inquiry is that they are usually short. Businesses often write letters of inquiry to other businesses to request information and literature or to order goods or services. These types of letters are routine and should contain only the information the receiver needs to respond. Letters of inquiry requesting information usually are not complex. Social business letters do not request information but often are used to express thanks or congratulations.

Multitasking. The computer's operating system consists of the components needed to run all of the computer applications and programs. When the operating system allows the user to open and use more than one software program at a time, it has multitasking abilities. An operating system that allows more than one user to access a particular program at one time has multiuser capabilities.

Cultural sensitivity. Culture is the set of customs, habits, and traditions of a particular group of people. The way that different people interact with one another is an expression of their culture. Businesspeople need to be sensitive to the fact that their foreign customers may have unique customs such as bowing when they greet rather than shaking hands. They should accept these customs and try to make their foreign customers feel comfortable. Businesspeople who behave in this manner are showing respect for other customs and habits and are exhibiting cultural sensitivity. Communication skills are abilities to express yourself clearly and simply. Stereotypical behavior involves acting in a manner that conforms to a set image.

Buying power. The Calvert Automobile Company situation is an example of rationing. Rationing is a function of relative prices that determines who gets the goods produced or how scarce resources will be distributed. In this situation, the 1,500 out of 500,000 individuals who are willing and able to pay a very high price to obtain the sports car have buying power—the ability (financial resources) to purchase the scarce item. Absolute advantage is the advantage achieved when a nation can produce a good or service for less than another nation. Market position is the rank of a particular business in a specific market. Unit control is a way of keeping track of inventory according to the number of units in stock.

The first thing Cameron should do when he realizes he has lost his wallet is to cancel his credit cards. By canceling the credit cards, Cameron will protect himself in the event that someone finds his wallet and attempts to use the credit cards. Financial institutions and businesses (e.g., retailers) issue credit cards, not government agencies. Cameron should contact the proper law enforcement authorities (e.g., police) if he thinks his wallet is stolen.
