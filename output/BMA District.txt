1. To sell sweatshirts, jackets, and T-shirts imprinted with ABC University's logo, the Collegiate Sportswear Company pays royalties to the university. What type of business ownership does this situation exemplify? 
A. Business-format franchise
B. Licensing agreement
C. General partnership
D. Multilevel marketing

1. B
Licensing agreement. A licensing agreement is a business structure that requires the authorization or permission from an owner to another entity to use trademarked (e.g., logo, name), copyrighted, or patented material for a specific activity, during a specific time period, for the profit of both parties. In the example, the sportswear company pays the university to use its logo, so the business arrangement involves a licensing agreement. A business-format franchise is a franchise arrangement in which the franchisee must operate under the trade name of the parent company that provides continuous assistance in setting up and operating the business. Multilevel marketing refers to a business, usually well-known, that pays commissions on sales earned to people at two or more levels. The sales representatives usually work independently of the company. A general partnership is a form of business ownership in which two or more individuals own the business, and each partner shares responsibility for the business's liabilities.

2. Which of the following statements is true about the directing function of management: 
A. It uses standardized communication.
B. It is results driven rather than performance driven.
C. It is a continuous process.
D. It primarily occurs at the lowest level of the organization.

2. C
It is a continuous process. Directing is the management function of providing guidance to workers and work projects. To varying degrees, managers need to guide their employees' work activities on an ongoing basis; therefore, directing is a continuous process. Employees' personalities and needs vary, so managers often use different communication styles to guide and motivate them. Directing occurs at all levels of an organization and is a performance-driven function that managers use to obtain the desired results or goals.

Installment. Installment credit is often used to make major purchases such as cars and trucks. The title of ownership will carry the purchaser's name, but the seller may hold the title or have a claim against it until all installment payments are complete. Regular and revolving credit purchases pass legal ownership to the buyer at the time of purchase. Trade credit is credit extended by one business to another business.

4. Belinda is reviewing departmental reports to determine why the business's outputs have been decreasing steadily over the last six weeks. Belinda is analyzing issues related to 
A. human resources.
B. finance.
C. production.
D. distribution.

4. C
Production. Business analysis is the process of investigating and evaluating a business issue, problem, process, or approach. Analysis helps the business determine if it is accomplishing its goals or if it needs to make adjustments so it can accomplish its goals. Businesses analyze many types of situations. Production is the process of producing goods and services. When the business detects production problems (e.g., output decreases), it needs to obtain data to find out why problems are occurring so it can take the appropriate steps to resolve the problem. Distribution is the business function of moving or transferring the ownership of goods or services from producers to consumers. Finance is the business function that involves the management of money. Human resources are the people who work to produce goods and services.

Administer first aid. If someone you are working with cuts or scratches themselves, the first thing that you should do is administer first aid. Jorge, for instance, should help Kendall treat her cut. If the injury is serious, you should also call the paramedics and have the worker taken to the hospital for medical treatment. It is not necessary to call the coworker's doctor. After the worker's injury has been treated, you will both need to fill out an accident report. If someone is injured, you should help them, not ignore them and continue with your work.

7. C
Demand. A demand letter is a letter sent to a person informing them of a legal dispute. Demand letters are used in small-claim disputes to inform a person of the legal dispute and to ask for relief. Relief is the course of action that would satisfy someone who files a lawsuit. Generally, relief is restitution. A termination letter informs someone that they were fired from a job. An official letter is simply a formal letter. A demand letter is a step further than a warning letter. A warning letter would simply indicate a problem to the letter-reader.

Groupware. Groupware is specialized software that allows users to work on documents together, share files, and communicate quickly and easily. While some groupware requires users to collaborate through an intranet, much of today's groupware is internet-based, allowing group members in multiple locations to work together online. Many Web 2.0 tools such as Google Apps are groupware applications. Shareware is essentially sample software. It gives consumers an opportunity to try software free of charge before purchasing it. Because it is merely a sample, the shareware is likely to be limited in functionality or time. Spyware is malicious software installed on computers to gather users' personal information.

A. take legal action against the other organizations.
B. lose its customers' trust.
C. damage others' reputations.
D. offer deep discounts to gain back its customers' loyalty.

14. B
Lose its customers' trust. Customers typically do not like businesses to share their contact information with other organizations without their permission. When this occurs, customers become distrustful of the business and often go to competitors to obtain the products they need and want. As a result, the offending business may lose sales and profits and is likely to develop an unfavorable reputation. The customers may want to take legal action against the business that shared their personal information without obtaining permission. A business's response to customer defections may or may not involve offering discounts to gain back its customers' loyalty.

15. Lamont Enterprises is using a trademark that looks very similar to the Seward Company's trademark. To prevent Lamont from continuing to use the trademark, Seward can take legal action by 
A. obtaining an arrest warrant.
B. charging Lamont with obstruction of justice.
C. filing an infringement lawsuit against Lamont.
D. requiring Lamont to pay a licensing fee.

15. C
Filing an infringement lawsuit against Lamont. A trademark is a symbol, design, or word used by a producer to identify a good or service. To prevent unauthorized use of the trademark (or a similar trademark), the trademark owner should register the trademark with the government. If another company (Lamont) uses a trademark that is similar to one that has been previously registered (Seward), the original owner (Seward) can file an infringement lawsuit against the company (Lamont) to stop the unauthorized use. And in some situations, the owner can obtain monetary damages from the unauthorized user. Directly asking Lamont to pay a fee is not a legal action. Obstruction of justice is a formal charge in which the judicial system accuses an individual with the crime of withholding critical evidence that can affect the outcome of a trial. An arrest warrant is an order issued by a judge that instructs law-enforcement officers to bring to jail an individual who has been charged with a crime.

Paying them the ultimate compliment. Giving recognition to someone is like paying them the ultimate compliment—by recognizing that person, you show them that they are valued and respected, deepening your relationship. A culture of recognition does not mean that people are playing favorites, and it does not mean that people who give recognition value the success of others over their own. Giving recognition to someone does not mean that you must ignore all of that person's flaws and mistakes; rather, it means that you choose to focus on that person's successes and achievements.

A. Advise employees that following business ethics depends on the situation
B. Assume employees know what constitutes ethical behavior
C. Allow employees to follow their own set of ethics
D. Train employees about expectations in relation to workplace ethics

26. D
Train employees about expectations in relation to workplace ethics. Employees must clearly understand the business's ethical standards and expectations. Offering ethics training can help employees understand the business's rules and ethical standards. Employees who do not have a clear understanding of the business's expectations in relation to ethical behavior put the business at risk. Employees who do not follow the business's ethics guidelines may cross a legal line without knowing they have done so. Because employees' experiences and beliefs often vary and because there are many gray areas in the business world, the business should not allow employees to follow their personal set of ethics or assume that the employees know what the business considers ethical behavior. Ethics are a set of principles that do not vary by situation.

27. Building and maintaining political relationships within an organization is often beneficial because it often 
A. creates a conflict-free working environment.
B. helps employees and the company accomplish objectives.
C. prevents the competition from losing market share.
D. reduces the need to seek information from outside sources.

27. B
Helps employees and the company accomplish objectives. Employees build political relationships in business to influence others (e.g., coworkers, managers) to take a certain course of action. The ability to influence others requires the employee to develop negotiation and conflict resolution skills. For example, an employee may need help from another person who works in another department to complete a project or activity. If the employee has developed a positive relationship with the other person, they are more likely to get the other person to help complete the project, which helps the company achieve a business objective. A person who builds a positive reputation and who continually meets the company's objectives is more likely to be promoted, thereby achieving their career goals. A successful company is concerned with maintaining or increasing its own market share rather than protecting a competitor's market share. Successful businesses often need to obtain information from outside sources, which does not depend on the political relationships that develop within the company.

Free-floating currency is the opposite of pegged. Its value fluctuates based on supply and demand. In terms of U.S. dollars, an indirect quote is the number of U.S. dollars that one unit of a foreign currency could buy. In terms of U.S. dollars, a direct quote is the number of a foreign currency that one dollar could buy. For example, a direct quote for the units could be U.S. $1.50 = 1 Euro.

30. B
Continue to treat them with courtesy and respect. Even if a customer is difficult and demanding, they should still be treated well. You should never ignore a customer, and it's out of line to tell a customer that their attitude is inappropriate. You also shouldn't confront customers. Even if they're being rude, you still must treat them respectfully. Be careful about making promises to the customer that you might not be able to fulfill.

Being able to respect and appreciate other people's unique viewpoints does not necessarily allow you to take on more responsibility at work; however, the ability to handle diverse viewpoints is a valuable skill that can make you an attractive job applicant. Your ability to work efficiently is not related to your ability to appreciate other viewpoints. People will not take advantage of you when you respect and appreciate their opinions.

35. Kara is preparing the work breakdown structure (WBS) for a new project. She has prepared five work packages. She has estimated the time to complete each package as follows: Package A—26 hours; Package B—50 hours; Package C—38 hours; Package D—6 hours; and Package E—15 hours. If Kara's estimates are accurate, has she followed the 8/80 rule? 
A. Yes, the average time to complete each package is 27 hours, which meets the 8/80 criteria.
B. Yes, Kara has scheduled the packages so that each one does not exceed 80 hours.
C. No, package D does not meet the minimum requirement of taking eight hours to complete.
D. No, Kara has scheduled more than 80 hours of work for the entire project.

35. C
No, package D does not meet the minimum requirement of taking eight hours to complete. A work breakdown structure (WBS) is the process of dividing project tasks into meaningful components to complete the project. Dividing the project into small work packages helps the project manager effectively schedule, assign, and monitor project activities. The 8/80 rule for dividing project work packages states that no package should take less than eight hours or more than 80 hours to complete. This rule intends to keep work packages in manageable units—not too small or too large. Because Kara allocated six hours to complete package D, she did not follow the 8/80 rule.

Establish benchmarks. Continuous improvement is the ongoing practice of looking for ways to increase the levels of excellence in relation to a process, good, or service. To determine if a business is improving the quality of its various products and processes, it needs to establish benchmarks—ways to provide a basis for comparison or evaluation of various components. If a business determines that benchmarks are not being achieved, then it may need to change processes or take corrective action. Change might include soliciting new customers or implementing new policies, depending on the situation being evaluated.

44. Which of the following measures of central tendency is the most influenced by outliers at the extremes of a data set: 
A. Mode
B. Mean
C. Median
D. Range

44. B
Mean. The mean, often referred to as the “average” of a data set, is calculated by adding together the values of all items in a data set and then dividing by the number of items. This number can be heavily influenced by outliers because it uses all items in its calculation. Median refers to the item in a data set that occurs in the middle when the items are listed by value from the lowest to the highest. Therefore, median is much less affected by outliers than the mean. Mode refers to the item that occurs the most frequently in a data set. Since outliers, by definition, occur less frequently, they do not affect the mode. Range is the difference between the item of highest value and the item of lowest value in the data set. It is not a measure of central tendency.

Comparison shopping is the act of visiting other businesses to learn what competing stores are selling and the prices they charge in order to get the best price for the product(s) or service(s) you want or need. Lakshna demonstrated comparison shopping by visiting multiple businesses to compare prices before making a purchase decision. Currency speculation means buying, selling, or holding currencies in an effort to profit from fluctuations in exchange rates. Merchandising is a career involving the selection of products so that the right goods are in the right place at the right time to make a profit.

47. C
The Dunder Mifflin Paper Company ships 12 cases of copy paper to the KMV Company on the third Wednesday of every month. Standing orders involve sending products at set intervals. This type of purchase order is ideal for businesses that need the same amount of an item on a regular basis. The electronics retailer placed an advance order, which is a regular order that requests delivery at a future time—weeks or months before needing the items. Businesses often place advanced orders for new items when they anticipate a high demand for them. The assistant buyer placed a blanket order, which is an order that covers all or part of a retailer's seasonal requirements. Businesses typically place blanket orders several months before the season and do not contain detailed specifications or shipping dates. Mr. and Mrs. McPherson placed a special order, which is a request for a custom item that a vendor does not normally carry in stock.

B. emergency funds guarantee that you will be okay even if you never work again.
C. it will protect you during a catastrophe, such as a health emergency or unemployment.
D. you won't need to save for college or retirement if you have an emergency fund.

48. C
It will protect you during a catastrophe, such as a health emergency or unemployment. Emergency or “rainy day” funds are important safety nets in case of economic hardship. Saving up enough money to cover six months of living expenses will allow you to sustain yourself in the event of job loss, health emergency, loss of property, or tragedy. Ideally, you should never dip into your emergency fund until it is truly an emergency. Having an emergency fund won't guarantee that you will be financially healthy forever, but it can help you get back on your feet if you suffer a hardship. You should save for education and retirement costs in addition to your emergency fund.

A. procedural due process.
B. substantive due process.
C. the Takings Clause.
D. sovereign immunity.

49. A
Procedural due process. Procedural due process exists to ensure that individuals and businesses who are sued or charged with a crime have the opportunity to present evidence on their behalf before a court can impose a penalty. Requiring the government to go through a certain set of legal procedures before taking someone's liberty or property provides the person or business in question a greater chance of being treated fairly. Substantive due process exists to ensure that the government does not take away our fundamental rights (e.g., privacy). The Takings Clause requires the U.S. government to pay a fair price for any private property that it takes for public use. Sovereign immunity protects a federal government from lawsuits brought against it in foreign courts.

Maverick could admit a weakness that he is working on and ask if there are any other things he needs to improve. By admitting a personal flaw, Maverick is demonstrating that he can handle criticism so employees are encouraged to respond honestly. Simply asking for opinions about his leadership may seem like Maverick is looking for compliments, and employees may not offer helpful advice. Even if Maverick anticipates concerns, he should focus on listening to the feedback, not on providing explanations for his behavior. Asking employees to compare Maverick to the former manager may only lead to comparisons of his and their former manager's personality or style with little insight into how Maverick could improve.

68. Which of the following data change activities is considered a best practice: 
A. Leaving an old system intact until its replacement is completely up and running
B. Only keeping one copy of all data and systems to reduce redundancy
C. Planning for data change processes to occur during normal business hours
D. Keeping data change processes hidden from employees until they are completed

68. A
Leaving an old system intact until its replacement is completely up and running. The safest way to implement data change is to keep the old systems in place, untouched, until the new systems are completely ready for use. This prevents complete loss of data if the new system suddenly fails during transfer or if something else goes wrong. It's also a good idea to keep multiple copies of anything that is critical to the company's daily activities, such as servers, networks, hardware, and storage systems. You can never have too much redundancy when it comes to data change. It would be unwise to keep data change processes hidden from employees until they are completed, since the changes may affect employees' daily work life. To avoid interrupting normal workflow, major system changes should never be scheduled to occur during normal business hours.

A. Decisions that carry more weight
B. Unbiased third-party decision maker
C. Cost-effectiveness and efficiency
D. Higher payouts for defendants

74. C
Cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Mediation is an informal process during which two parties meet with an impartial third party to find a mutually satisfactory solution to a problem. A benefit of mediation is that it is costeffective and efficient, especially compared to going to trial. Mediation does not lead to higher payouts for the defendant. Mediation cannot impose a legally binding decision, so it does not carry more weight. Finally, while there is a third-party mediator, that person does not make decisions. Instead, they help guide the negotiation process while the two parties come to a decision on their own.

75. In Maria's community, the accumulation of wealth is a shared value that is often passed down from generation to generation. As a result, Maria is often attracted to luxury products. This is an example of a __________ influence on Maria's buying behavior. 
A. psychological
B. situational
C. personal
D. cultural

75. D
Cultural. A person's culture often has the most significant impact on their buying behavior. Culture is the system of values, traditions, and preferences that is handed down from one generation to the next. Because Maria's community values wealth, she is more likely to buy luxury products. This is an example of a cultural influence on her buying behavior, not a psychological, situational, or personal influence. Psychological influences have to do with a person's unique perception of the world. Situational influences are related to an individual's specific situation at the time. Personal influences include an individual's unique characteristics, such as their age, gender, stage of life, or occupation.

Risk retention group. A risk retention group is a type of insurance company that is owned by its members—its policyholders. As the owner of the insurance company, a risk retention group retains and controls its liability rather than transferring its risks to another entity. Because the risk retention group retains control, it retains the profits that it generates. Risk retention groups are typically formed by similar businesses and industries and pay lower licensing fees than traditional insurance companies. Local insurance agencies are not owned by their policyholders. Insurance brokers deal with many insurance carriers/products to meet the needs of their clients. An insurance underwriting association is a professional association, which is a group of individuals who work in the same profession.

99. When developing persuasive business letters, it is most important for the writers to think about the readers' 
A. possible objections.
B. personal images.
C. decision-making styles.
D. nonverbal cues.

99. A
Possible objections. The purpose of a persuasive letter is to convey information that encourages the reader to take a specific course of action. For example, the purpose of a sales letter is to motivate a person to buy a particular product. An objection is a reason for not taking a specific course of action. When developing persuasive messages, it is important for the writers to think about the readers' possible objections and acknowledge them. By acknowledging the objections and providing a rationale that removes the objections, the writers better position themselves in persuading the readers to take specific actions. Because each reader has different personal images and decisionmaking styles, it is not feasible for the writer to consider these factors if the letter is going to a lot of people. The readers' nonverbal cues cannot be seen when writing persuasive messages.
