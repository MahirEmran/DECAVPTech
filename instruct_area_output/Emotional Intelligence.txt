It is also part of your role as a cooperative team member. It would be inappropriate to share praise you receive for your own work as an individual. Management should encourage the team, but fellow team members should also encourage each other by giving praise for others' good ideas and hard work.

21. Jamison is ignorant of his new classmate's culture. In other words, Jamison is 
A. individualist.
B. ethnocentric.
C. unintelligent.
D. uninformed.

21. D
Uninformed. Saying that a person is ignorant just means they lack knowledge or information about something. Because Jamison is ignorant of his new classmate's culture, he is uninformed. If someone is ignorant, it does not mean they are unintelligent. Being ethnocentric means you believe your own culture is naturally better than others. Being individualistic means placing an emphasis on independent work and accomplishments. Jamison does not demonstrate ethnocentrism or individualism in this example.

A. open-ended questioning.
B. constructive criticism.
C. negative feedback.
D. nonverbal communication.

Constructive criticism. Constructive criticism is information that is designed to help the coachee improve. When Raquel gives constructive criticism, she tells Emil what he's doing wrong, but she also explains how to correct the behavior and perform better the next time. Nonverbal communication uses body language instead of words or to support words. Open-ended questions require more than a simple “yes” or “no” answer. Raquel should not use negative feedback.

C. It typically involves bragging.
D. It inspires confidence in friends and coworkers.

37. D
It inspires confidence in friends and coworkers. People with self-confidence inspire confidence in others, including their coworkers and friends. When you are confident, others believe in you. Although it can take time and effort to cultivate, anyone is capable of building their self-confidence. Self-confidence on its own does not offend or annoy people, and it should not involve bragging. If someone is annoying or offending others with their self-confidence, they may be overconfident.

A. exhibiting integrity.
B. developing self-control.
C. showing initiative.
D. behaving unethically.

51. B
Developing self-control. Self-control is the ability to manage your feelings, words, and actions. One step in developing self-control is identifying and avoiding triggers that cause you to lose control. Presley knows she could lose control when she is irritated by construction noise. She attempts to avoid the trigger of her stress by wearing headphones, which helps her to maintain self-control. Presley is not showing initiative, behaving unethically, or exhibiting integrity in this situation.

C. your friend needs help deciding which college to attend.

64. D
You are faced with a crossroads or a new decision in life. Your personal vision can act as a guidebook for your life, helping you make decisions when you are faced with difficult choices. It cannot, however, help your friend choose a college or your sibling choose a career path—your vision is only useful to you. Grocery shopping is not significant enough to consult your personal vision.

Startup failure rates are high. Leadership is especially important at the beginning of a business because startup failure rates are high. A strong leader with a vision for the future, however, can help a new business weather the early storms and frustrations and stay on track for future success. Startup businesses will still pay employees, and not every company necessarily needs to have a president. Anyone with the desire can learn to be a leader.

77. D
In different contexts and situations. A major part of being responsible means knowing how to act in different contexts and situations.

B. Ask her teammates to help complete it
C. Complete what she can before her work shift is over
D. Work late to complete it on time

81. D
Work late to complete it on time. Working late shows that Jhenae has initiative because she is willing to work hard to accomplish her assigned work.

A. Authoritarian
B. Democratic
C. Assertive
D. Laissez-faire

89. D
Laissez-faire. Laissez-faire leaders exercise little or no control over their subordinates. Democratic leaders seek input from employees and encourage them to participate in planning and decision-making. They tend to share authority with their subordinates. Authoritarians enjoy being in command. They rely almost completely upon their own judgment and give very specific orders and instructions to employees. Assertive is not a style of leadership.

Generous. Those who are fair to others share with everyone. They do not allow their own selfishness to outweigh their desire to give equally to those who deserve it. In this case, Trina is being generous by sharing the credit for a job well done with everyone on her team rather than keeping all the praise for herself.

A. face your fear head-on.
B. keep your fear hidden.
C. pretend your fear doesn't exist.
D. hope your fear will go away.

95. A
Face your fear head-on. If you fear change, acknowledge that fact, and work to overcome it. Face the change you fear head-on, and deal with it one step at a time. Pretending that your fear doesn't exist, hoping it will go away, or keeping it hidden are passive approaches that will not help you overcome your fear.

A. rotated to similar positions.
B. sent to a training program.
C. held legally responsible.
D. passed over for promotions.

96. D
Passed over for promotions. Most businesses try to act in an ethical manner, and they expect their employees to also behave ethically. Employees who behave unethically on the job may harm themselves by being passed over for promotions even if they are well qualified. Coworkers and supervisors often notice other employees' unethical behavior and may lose respect for them because of it. These employees may be passed over for promotions because their supervisors do not trust them to do the right thing, particularly in higher level positions that give them more authority. Employees are not harmed by attending training programs or being rotated to similar positions. Unethical behavior is not necessarily illegal.

5. An effective way to evaluate a risk is to determine 
A. inventory and probability.
B. objections and inventory.
C. probability and magnitude.
D. magnitude and body language.

5. C
Probability and magnitude. Probability is the likelihood of an event occurring while magnitude is the seriousness or extent of an event’s impact. Combining these two factors can help someone analyze possible risks when making a decision. Body language includes gestures, facial expressions, or other nonverbal forms of communication. Body language is rarely an effective way to evaluate risk. Inventory is the stock of goods a business possesses and is not directly related to determining risk.

C. Decision-making
D. Positive reinforcement

13. D
Positive reinforcement. Teammates who treat each other with respect and encouragement are likely to be more engaged in a shared vision. Positivity keeps people going when challenges arise. Criticism is not as likely to motivate engagement in a shared vision. Creativity is often the result of a shared vision, rather than a motivation for it.

C. wait to observe how this discovery impacts your life.
D. take small, manageable steps to close the gap.

15. D
Take small, manageable steps to close the gap. If you discover your values and behavior do not match up, you should take small, manageable steps to close the gap. Try to set a goal for yourself, such as taking one action per week that would support your personal values. You should not radically change your life to quickly adjust course. You should adjust your behavior instead of changing your values to include everything. It’s better to take small steps than to wait to observe how this impacts your life.

A. When you are experiencing success
B. When you use critical thinking skills
C. When you are in a leadership position
D. When you are challenging the status quo

33. A
When you are experiencing success. When things are going well, change doesn’t always seem necessary. This can lead to missed opportunities. If you are challenging the status quo, you have likely already identified a need to improve or change. Being in a leadership position does not necessarily mean you will overlook the need for change or improvement. In fact, a quality of a good leader is having the courage to suggest or implement change. When you are using critical thinking skills, you would most likely notice the need for improvement or change rather than overlook it.

A. communicated the rules more clearly.
B. enforced stricter punishments.
C. relaxed the company computer policy.
D. hired more ethical employees.

34. A
Communicated the rules more clearly. Ethics aren’t always black and white, and sometimes it can be challenging to know what to do or what is expected. Peter should have communicated his expectations and clearly explained how employees were supposed to use their company laptops. Enforcing stricter punishments and relaxing the computer policies would not necessarily help in this situation. There is no indication that Peter needs to hire more ethical employees. His current employees are not necessarily unethical; rather, they did not understand how to behave ethically due to a lack of communication.

B. Be patient and persistent
C. Reward yourself for your accomplishments
D. Take a break to refresh your mind

42. C
Reward yourself for your accomplishments. By inviting his team members to celebrate at a nearby restaurant after work, Ian is rewarding himself and his team for finishing their six-month project. This will help Ian and his team to stay motivated and to continue working hard to achieve their goals. This does not necessarily demonstrate being a leader or being patient and persistent. Encouraging feedback and taking a break to refresh your mind are not steps in developing an achievement orientation.

68. A helpful way to identify your strengths and weaknesses involves receiving __________ from others. 
A. compliments
B. self-esteem
C. feedback
D. compensation

68. C
Feedback. Feedback is evaluative information given to you about the things you say and do. When it comes to receiving feedback about your weaknesses, it may be a little tough to handle. Keep in mind that growth and development aren’t always easy but are necessary for success. Then, use the feedback to your advantage as you continue to assess your strengths and weaknesses. Receiving compensation is not a way to identify strengths and weaknesses. Compliments are nice, but they are not always helpful in assessing strengths and weaknesses. Self-esteem is not something you receive from someone else, but something that comes from you.

A. Acceptance
B. Sympathy
C. Empathy

74. D
Self-awareness. Self-awareness is understanding the influence and effect you have on others.

Selfawareness can be demonstrated in small ways, such as holding the door open for the person behind you or cleaning the microwave after you use it. Empathy is the ability to relate to the feelings, thoughts, and experiences of other people. Sympathy is the ability to recognize another person’s feelings. Acceptance is the approval or tolerance of all people, regardless of their behavior or performance.

A. Greater job satisfaction
B. Personal and professional growth
C. Increased retention of top talent
D. Better communities and relationships

91. C
Increased retention of top talent. Businesses with collaborative work environments can attract top talent and are more likely to retain it as well. High-performing individuals seek opportunities to engage with others and increase their knowledge and skills. When employees are engaged at work, they experience more job satisfaction and are likely to stay on board for the long term. Personal and professional growth, as well as greater job satisfaction, are benefits employees experience from collaboration. Better communities and relationships are societal benefits of collaboration.

93. Which of the following would be an appropriate goal for someone with a personal vision that involves working to cure cancer: 
A. Attend religious seminary
B. Get accepted to medical school
C. Write a best-selling novel
D. Graduate from law school

93. B
Get accepted to medical school. Having a personal vision allows you to set goals that fully align with your ultimate ambitions, making seemingly tough decisions much easier. For example, if your personal vision involves working to cure cancer, an appropriate goal would be to get accepted to medical school. You wouldn’t make it your goal to get accepted to law school or religious seminary, because those goals do not align with your personal vision. Writing a best-selling novel also does not align with working to cure cancer. As you can see, having a personal vision ensures that you are spending your time and efforts on pursuits that are truly important to you.

Persistent. Even though he wants to give up, Marco continues working through his trigonometry homework problems—Marco is being persistent. Persistence is the ability to continue working on a task or idea until the desired outcome is achieved. Altruism is the principle of concern for others’ welfare. Respect is regard or esteem and involves honoring the rights, freedoms, views, and property of others. Transparency is the quality of being just as one seems and being open and truthful while communicating.

What step can Andrew use to help him tolerate ambiguity in the moment? 
A. Focus on creativity
B. Assess risks
C. Stay calm and neutral
D. Ask questions

A. negative
B. positive
C. internal
D. critical

6. B
Positive. Feedback is evaluative information about you, your behavior, or the results of your behavior. It can be positive or negative in nature. Positive feedback involves praise (compliments, commendations, etc.) and tends to reinforce the behavior that it recognizes. Internal feedback comes from within yourself. Critical or negative feedback tends to make people want to change their behavior.

7. Standing very close to someone with whom you are talking can be an indication of __________ behavior. 
A. passive
B. assertive
C. aggressive
D. subversive

7. C
Aggressive. Aggressive behavior is conduct based on a willingness to ignore the rights of others and to take advantage of them to achieve personal goals. Aggressive behavior is sometimes called attack behavior. One form of attack behavior is called "in-your-face" behavior, and it involves an individual standing too close to another person when talking with them. Passive behavior is conduct in which people fail to exercise their rights and to respect their own needs. Assertive behavior is conduct based on respect for your own rights and for the rights of others. Subversive behavior is intended to undermine or overthrow some form of government.

A. business cycle.
B. orderly environment.
C. positive attitude.
D. partnership agreement.

11. C
Positive attitude. Interest and enthusiasm are part of a positive attitude, which gives you a good outlook on life. Although you will still encounter frustrations and disappointments, you won't be kept down very long by them. Your interest in life and your enthusiasm will soon reassert themselves. Business cycles are periods of expansion and contraction in economic activities. An orderly, systematic environment can be obtained without interest and enthusiasm. A partnership agreement is a written agreement signed by business partners that specifies the terms of the partnership.

A. circumstances are always changing.
B. you can control the way others react.
C. fear of the unknown induces change.
D. it is always OK to stay in your comfort zone.

18. A
Circumstances are always changing. To be adaptable, you must first recognize that circumstances are always changing. When you recognize that change is inevitable, then you can relax and develop a mindset to "expect the unexpected," which will help you handle changes when they occur. Staying in your comfort zone and being fearful are barriers to adaptability. Although you can't control the way others react in a situation, you can control the way you react.

B. share the good and bad of your life with others.
C. avoid sharing your feelings with others.
D. be critical of yourself when you make a mistake.

D. "I'm sorry the job didn't get done, but the other workers left early."

23. A
"I told my supervisor I would work on Friday nights, so I will be here Friday." Employees who do what they say they will do are demonstrating responsible behavior. Making excuses is not acceptable, and employees should assist each other. Supervisors should be consulted when there are problems with difficult customers. Employees should be willing to perform extra job duties in addition to their regular duties.

B. Caleb uses “um” and “like” in his conversations.
C. Keisha texts her supervisor “2 sick 4 work, sry.”
D. Muriel ignores her roommate's text message.

49. D
Muriel ignores her roommate's text message. Receivers often make mistakes when communicating that can prevent the effective transmission of messages. Effective communication requires a two-way connection to work, and receivers create barriers to communication when they don't practice active listening, forget to complete the requested follow-up actions, and fail to respond to a written message. By ignoring her roommate's text message, Muriel is creating a barrier to communication. Caleb using “um” and “like” in his conversations and Keisha texting her supervisor using slang are examples of senders creating barriers to communication. Courtland taking notes during a meeting is an example of effective communication.

C. Martha knocks on the door before entering the meeting room to tell Ryan that his client has arrived.
D. Kevin takes Sarah's stapler off her desk after she tells him it is OK to borrow it for a while.

56. A
John reads the email message on Suzanne's computer screen while she is away from her desk. Successful employees realize the importance of respecting others' privacy in the workplace. When employees respect others' privacy, they are likely to gain the trust and respect of coworkers and managers. Reading a coworker's email without permission is rude and an invasion of privacy. Leaving the room when another person receives a personal telephone call, knocking on the door before entering the room, and asking to borrow an item before taking it are actions that are respectful of others' privacy.

63. A
Short-term goal; long-term goal. Goals can be short-term or long-term. Short-term goals take less than a year to achieve, whereas long-term goals take a year or more. Going one day without eating desserts is a short-term goal, whereas improving your health overall could take more than a year and is therefore a long-term goal.

C. informed; disrespect
D. educated; goals in mind

Ethical; integrity. Knowing your values also helps you make ethical decisions and act with integrity. Since your values are what matter most to you, they can help you uphold your principles in difficult situations. You will be less tempted to act unethically if you have a strong sense of what is important to you. Using your values as a guide does not necessarily help you make educated, controversial, or informed decisions, nor does it help you act with goals in mind, discretion, or disrespect.

A. Leaders need to be confident that what they are doing is acceptable.
B. Leaders learn to outlast business fads and trends.
C. Leaders are expected to take action after problems develop.
D. Leaders have to get along with a wide variety of people.

70. D
Leaders have to get along with a wide variety of people. Emotional intelligence and leadership overlap when it comes to proactive behavior, perseverance, positive working relationships, and confidence. To engage in positive working relationships, leaders have to get along with a wide variety of people, sometimes encouraging others and sometimes inspiring them. With proactive behavior, leaders are expected to take action before problems develop. With perseverance, leaders learn to outlast disappointment and fatigue. Learning to outlast business fads and trends is not a part of emotional intelligence, nor is it necessarily a part of leadership. Regarding confidence, leaders need to be confident that what they are doing and saying is right—not (merely) acceptable.

72. Why is it important for individuals to assess their personal strengths and weaknesses? 
A. To be able to respond appropriately in a crisis
B. To be able to negotiate their contracts
C. To get the most bang for their buck
D. To improve their performance

72. D
To improve their performance. Each individual has personal strengths and weaknesses. Assessing strengths will allow an individual to build on those strengths. It is also important to assess weaknesses because those are areas that need improvement. For example, an individual might find that it will be necessary to improve their computer skills to improve performance and be considered for a promotion. It may be difficult to improve performance if individuals have not identified their personal strengths and weaknesses. Assessing personal strengths and weaknesses will not necessarily help individuals respond appropriately in a crisis, negotiate contracts, or get the most bang for their buck.

84. Taking responsibility for your actions involves 
A. responding to criticism in a defensive manner.
B. letting others accept the blame for your mistakes.
C. admitting your mistakes.
D. justifying your errors.

84. C
Admitting your mistakes. Taking responsibility for your actions often involves admitting that you made a mistake and that you are willing to accept the consequences of your actions. Although it is difficult to admit your mistakes, taking responsibility for them indicates that you are an honest person, which is a trait that employers value. Letting others accept blame for your mistakes, justifying your errors, and responding to criticism in a defensive manner are not ways in which you take responsibility for your actions.

A. Communicate often and openly
B. Apologize for her mistakes
C. Keep confidential information private
D. Prioritize the needs of others

93. D
Prioritize the needs of others. You can't build trust in your relationships if you only care about yourself. That's why it's so important to prioritize the needs of others. This doesn't mean that you should completely ignore your own needs, but it does mean you must show empathy and think about how your actions can benefit other people. Apologizing for mistakes is part of taking responsibility for them. Keeping confidential information private and communicating often and openly are other techniques that can be used to build trust.

95. Businesspeople who respect the unique customs and habits of their foreign customers are exhibiting 
A. communication skills.
B. language differences.
C. cultural sensitivity.
D. stereotypical behavior.

95. C
Cultural sensitivity. Culture is the set of customs, habits, and traditions of a particular group of people. The way that different people interact with one another is an expression of their culture. Businesspeople need to be sensitive to the fact that their foreign customers may have unique customs such as bowing when they greet rather than shaking hands. They should accept these customs and try to make their foreign customers feel comfortable. Businesspeople who behave in this manner are showing respect for other customs and habits and are exhibiting cultural sensitivity. Communication skills are abilities to express yourself clearly and simply. Stereotypical behavior involves acting in a manner that conforms to a set image. Language differences occur when people speak different languages.

A. negative feedback.
B. constructive criticism.
C. internal feedback.
D. self-control.

16. B
Constructive criticism. Constructive criticism is evaluative information designed to help someone improve. Negative feedback is feedback involving criticism, a negative judgment about you or your behavior; it tends to make you want to change or modify your words or actions. Internal feedback is feedback that comes from within yourself. Self-control is the restraint of your feelings, words, and actions.

Paying them the ultimate compliment. Giving recognition to someone is like paying them the ultimate compliment—by recognizing that person, you show them that they are valued and respected, deepening your relationship. A culture of recognition does not mean that people are playing favorites, and it does not mean that people who give recognition value the success of others over their own. Giving recognition to someone does not mean that you must ignore all of that person's flaws and mistakes; rather, it means that you choose to focus on that person's successes and achievements.

27. Building and maintaining political relationships within an organization is often beneficial because it often 
A. creates a conflict-free working environment.
B. helps employees and the company accomplish objectives.
C. prevents the competition from losing market share.
D. reduces the need to seek information from outside sources.

27. B
Helps employees and the company accomplish objectives. Employees build political relationships in business to influence others (e.g., coworkers, managers) to take a certain course of action. The ability to influence others requires the employee to develop negotiation and conflict resolution skills. For example, an employee may need help from another person who works in another department to complete a project or activity. If the employee has developed a positive relationship with the other person, they are more likely to get the other person to help complete the project, which helps the company achieve a business objective. A person who builds a positive reputation and who continually meets the company's objectives is more likely to be promoted, thereby achieving their career goals. A successful company is concerned with maintaining or increasing its own market share rather than protecting a competitor's market share. Successful businesses often need to obtain information from outside sources, which does not depend on the political relationships that develop within the company.

Have constructive dialogue with others. An important component of effective communication is respect. When you are able to respect and appreciate other people's unique viewpoints, you can have constructive dialogue with people of all backgrounds. Being able to respect and appreciate other people's unique viewpoints does not necessarily allow you to take on more responsibility at work; however, the ability to handle diverse viewpoints is a valuable skill that can make you an attractive job applicant. Your ability to work efficiently is not related to your ability to appreciate other viewpoints. People will not take advantage of you when you respect and appreciate their opinions. Rather, they will most likely return the favor and respect and appreciate your own opinions.

A. Maverick could admit a weakness that he is working on and ask if there are any other things he needs to
improve. B. Maverick could anticipate concerns his employees are likely to have about his management style and
prepare possible explanations. C. Maverick could simply ask employees if they believe he is effectively leading the accounting department.
D. Maverick could ask his employees to compare his leadership with the leadership of the former department

63. A
Maverick could admit a weakness that he is working on and ask if there are any other things he needs to improve. By admitting a personal flaw, Maverick is demonstrating that he can handle criticism so employees are encouraged to respond honestly. Simply asking for opinions about his leadership may seem like Maverick is looking for compliments, and employees may not offer helpful advice. Even if Maverick anticipates concerns, he should focus on listening to the feedback, not on providing explanations for his behavior. Asking employees to compare Maverick to the former manager may only lead to comparisons of his and their former manager's personality or style with little insight into how Maverick could improve.

Live up to their promises. Coworkers know they can count on honest workers to do what they say they will do, to give them straight answers, and to try to do the right thing.

It takes education, training, and practice to be effective. Ethical behavior includes actions that are consistent with values, both your own and those of society. Ethical behavior doesn’t just happen; it takes education, training, and practice to be effective. Ethical behavior is crucial because it helps people and organizations to avoid—not lead to—negative consequences. Ethical behavior does not prevent all temptations to act unethically.

A. Ambiguity has nothing to do with risk.
B. It’s possible to avoid ambiguity in today's world.
C. Ambiguity refers to certainty and clarity.
D. Tolerating ambiguity means being OK with uncertainty.

74. D
Tolerating ambiguity means being OK with uncertainty. Ambiguity is a state of vagueness, doubt, and uncertainty. Tolerance is the capacity to accept deviation from the norm. Tolerating ambiguity, therefore, means being OK with uncertainty and dealing with it effectively. Ambiguity and risk go hand in hand, as risk is inherent in virtually all ambiguous situations, especially if there’s a chance that things could go wrong. As much as we would like to avoid it, uncertainty and ambiguity are everywhere and unavoidable. They are a part of life.

Therefore, stubbornness—an unwillingness to change—is not an aspect of being open to new ideas. Part of being open-minded is stepping out of your comfort zone.

Buying a backpack. Buying a new backpack is a limited decision because it is not made frequently and involves some degree of consideration. Taking a shower and ordering lunch are everyday decisions that are considered routine decisions. Purchasing a car carries substantial risk and long-term impact—therefore, it is an extensive decision, not a limited decision.

A. hostility.
B. resentment.
C. guilt.
D. denial.

15. D
Denial. Jack is experiencing denial when he refuses to acknowledge the negative effects that not taking responsibility for decisions and actions has had on his life. People can experience denial without necessarily being hostile (argumentative, angry) about it. Guilt is a negative feeling people experience when they've done something they shouldn't or have not done something they should. Resentment is a feeling of bitterness that people experience when they think they've been treated unfairly.

30. Which of the following statements is true about emotional intelligence: 
A. In many situations, individuals can improve their levels of emotional intelligence.
B. Effective leaders tend to have low emotional intelligence and high cognitive abilities.
C. Research indicates that emotional intelligence rarely affects a person's career success.
D. It is easier to develop cognitive abilities than it is to develop emotional intelligence levels.

30. A
In many situations, individuals can improve their levels of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and manage emotions in ourselves and in others. Individuals who are willing to recognize, evaluate, and change the way they relate with others can improve their emotional intelligence. People who have high levels of emotional intelligence tend to be effective leaders and achieve career success because they can relate well with others. Cognitive intelligence involves the ability to reason and apply logic. An individual's cognitive abilities are influenced by biological and heredity factors, which are not easily changed.

A. decreased managerial authority.
B. imprisonment.
C. an increased customer base.
D. a poor reputation.

52. D
A poor reputation. Even when no laws have been broken, unethical behavior still reflects poorly on individuals and organizations, damaging their reputations. Unethical behavior generally does not lead to an increased customer base. Imprisonment is a negative consequence that would follow an illegal action. Decreased managerial authority is not necessarily related to unethical actions.

62. C
Not sharing confidential information. Although being honest is an important part of being trustworthy, it's just as important to keep confidential information to yourself. By not sharing the information you overheard, you are building trust in your relationship with your boss. Taking responsibility for your mistakes, keeping your promises, and communicating often and openly are other techniques used to build trust.

64. Emily's classmate is upset because they are having a hard time understanding the new concepts they're learning in math class. Which of the following actions should Emily take if she wants to show her classmate empathy: 
A. Think of a time when she had difficulty with an assignment, and tell the classmate she knows how they feel
B. Tell the classmate they should sign up for after-school tutoring so that their grades will improve
C. Let the classmate copy her answers on their next test
D. Ask the classmate how long they studied for their last test

64. A
Think of a time when she had difficulty with an assignment, and tell the classmate she knows how they feel. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in another person's place. This can help you respect others because you are able to better understand other people. If Emily thinks about a time when she has felt the same as her classmate, she is showing empathy. Letting her classmate copy her answers or asking them how much they studied would not show empathy. Telling the classmate to sign up for after-school tutoring may be helpful, but it is not empathetic.

A. justifying them.
B. understanding them.

Understanding them. For project managers, the most important part of managing stakeholder expectations is understanding them. Only when project teams feel they fully comprehend what stakeholders expect can they start to manage those expectations. It would not make sense to compete against stakeholder expectations or delegate them. Stakeholders would be the ones justifying their expectations, not project managers.

D. transition period.

4. D
Transition period. Transition periods are designed to allow you to adjust to your new surroundings over time. By adjusting slowly to his new job duties, Nilesh was less likely to feel overwhelmed. Resource issues occur when you don't have enough of a resource (people, money, information, ideas, and other essential items that are used to produce or do something). Government regulations deal with laws. Emergencies include situations like fires or floods that demand quick action and adaptation by everyone involved.

A. Using a "give-and-take" tactic to reach an agreement
B. Giving the other person as much time as they need to decide
C. Pushing the other person into making a decision
D. Insisting on your terms during the negotiation process

9. A
Using a "give-and-take" tactic to reach an agreement. This tactic is known as bargaining, and it can be a highly effective negotiation strategy. Each person proposes solutions and uses "give-and-take" tactics to reach an agreement. You may have to give up something, but you get something in return. During negotiations, you should give the salesperson a specific deadline to meet your request. It's a way of making the negotiation real and specific. An advantage to this strategy is that it introduces a deadline as a negotiable point. If you set a deadline earlier than is necessary, you can build in negotiating room. Similarly, if you show no flexibility whatsoever during a negotiation, the other person may decide that it's not worth their time to speak with you.

A. strategic relationship.
B. distribution channel.
C. contingency plan.
D. communications plan.

69. A
Strategic relationship. A strategic relationship is one in which multiple businesses enter into an agreement and help each other, financially or otherwise. Often, the partnering businesses have assets or services that may help the other. A communications plan is a document that contains strategies for managing the flow of information that must occur between all of a project's stakeholders throughout the life of the project. A contingency plan is a set of specific guidelines to help respond to undesirable circumstances. A distribution channel is a path or route that goods or services take from the producer to the ultimate consumer or industrial user. Although every business must have at least one distribution channel, sharing a warehouse facility as a means to save money is not an example of a distribution channel.

Celebrating together. Celebrating is an important part of team recognition. You probably recall a time when you and a team or group celebrated your success together. Maybe your baseball team had an end-of-season party, or your math class held an end-of-semester celebration. Celebrating together usually means planning an activity everyone can enjoy while taking a moment to reflect on the team’s goals and accomplishments. Going public, giving certificates, and written praise are all forms of recognition, but celebrating together is the most important for team recognition.

64. If a business is looking to build strategic relationships, it should 
A. tailor its communication.
B. focus on its own needs.
C. seek a deal as soon as possible.
D. avoid asking questions.

64. A
Tailor its communication. Strategic relationships are successfully formed when both sides share a common vision that they can work toward together. Both parties will be equally motivated to succeed. When looking to build strategic relationships, businesses should tailor their communication to the interests and communication preferences of the other party. By doing this, businesses can ensure their communication in the relationship is effective. While it is important to consider yourself and your needs, it is also important to consider the needs of others, especially in a strategic relationship. Seeking a deal as soon as possible and not asking questions are not ways in which businesses should look to build strategic relationships. Rather, businesses should be willing to take the time to communicate and negotiate with other businesses when seeking a deal, and should ask questions to ensure that they are on the same page.

Doing this will help companies tailor their approach to suit each stakeholder group. Companies should manage stakeholders differently, as projects typically have a range of different stakeholders and, thus, a broad range of expectations. Companies should also keep their stakeholders in the loop. Rather than setting lofty expectations, companies should set realistic expectations with their stakeholders.

The opposite is true, too: If you don’t believe in the value of their effort, they’ll pick up on the emptiness of your message. Even though De’Vondre said he liked her logo, Camilla is likely to pick up on his true feelings. In this situation De’Vondre’s recognition was personalized and timely, and it matched the effort.

27. A
“You won't regret this decision—I am confident my idea will help our organization.” This statement would be appropriate to say after successfully selling an idea to others because it helps the audience feel good about their decision, rather than raising potential doubts about your idea's likelihood for success. The other three alternatives lack confidence in the idea, which would likely lead the audience to question their decision.

To improve performance. Team building involves developing cooperative efforts between employees and management to accomplish company goals and objectives. One reason why many businesses encourage team building is that it tends to improve the performance of the group so they are better able to achieve specific objectives. When team members work together for a common purpose, they usually are more effective and perform better than when employees work independently to achieve a common goal.

64. B
Is independent of factors that are already satisfied. In developed societies where most people already have access to basic necessities like food and shelter, extrinsic motivation isn't as effective as intrinsic motivation. Because external, low-level needs are of lesser concern, a person's individual ambitions and hopes are a more powerful motivator. By nature, intrinsic motivation is not tied to external rewards, nor does it come from outside one's personal desires. Similarly, intrinsic motivation cannot be easily altered by one's environment, because it is rooted within one's pursuit of self-actualization.

Groupthink. When a person makes a poor decision out of fear of disagreeing with a group, they are demonstrating groupthink behavior. Status quo bias refers to a preference to maintain the status quo and the view that a change from it is a loss. Acceptance refers to a conscious decision to personally agree with a practice instead of simply following the crowd.

Be true to your core values, beliefs, and attitudes. Reflecting on and processing what you have learned, otherwise known as critical thinking, will help you make an informed decision on a topic that feels true to your core values, beliefs, and attitudes. Being true to your values and beliefs does not mean proving to others that they are wrong. Sometimes, you may even realize that they are right and you are wrong. Being respectful helps you prevent offending or belittling others; reflecting on what you have learned is an internal process and does not necessarily impact how you treat others.

Be present in the moment instead of thinking about the past. Mindfulness is the state of being aware of the moment you are in, including your thoughts, feelings, and actions. Being mindful means being present where you are, rather than thinking about the past or worrying about the future. When the future is uncertain, you will accept it more if you can be present in the current moment rather than worrying about what you cannot predict or control. Trying new things and changing up her daily routine may help Jocelyn step out of her comfort zone, but it won't necessarily help her with practicing mindfulness.

99. Mateo, an employee at a retail store, is dealing with an angry customer. The customer is yelling, being disrespectful, and keeps talking over Mateo when he tries to help. How can Mateo model ethical behavior in this situation? 
A. Tell the customer they are being rude
B. Make the customer leave the store
C. Be disrespectful and yell back to the customer
D. Treat the customer with fairness

99. D
Treat the customer with fairness. Even though the customer is being rude and disrespectful, Mateo can model ethical behavior by treating the customer with fairness. Mateo can make the customer leave the store or tell them they are being rude, but doing either is not necessarily modeling ethical behavior. Being disrespectful and yelling back to the customer are not ways to model ethical behavior.

A. Strive for perfection
B. Ignore the problem
C. Exercise regularly
D. Vacation frequently

37. C
Exercise regularly. Most employees will experience a certain amount of stress at some time during their careers. Recognizing stress and taking steps to reduce or relieve it are essential to an employee's well-being. One way to relieve stress is to exercise on a regular basis. Exercise helps relieve tension, relax a person, and provide a physical outlet for pent-up emotions, such as anger or frustration. Even moderate exercise helps a person manage stress and stay healthy. Most employees are not able to vacation frequently. Ignoring the problem often increases stress. Striving for perfection often creates stress.

C. Paige sent a personal email from her work computer to her friend Alan.
D. Ruby saw that her coworkers were having a serious discussion, so she walked away.

89. B
Joe needed a pen, so he opened Ali's desk drawer to look for one while she was away. Employees should not go through their coworkers' desks, files, correspondence, or personal belongings in the workplace. To do so is a violation of privacy. When employees respect the privacy of others in the workplace, they are more likely to gain the trust and respect of their coworkers and managers. Walking away from a serious discussion and changing a document with the writer's approval are not violations of privacy. Sending a personal email from work is not an invasion of privacy, but it is wasting company resources because it is not business-related.

A. They look for ways to increase their productivity.
B. They often fail to follow directions.
C. They overuse their sick leave and other benefits.
D. They come to work late and leave early.

5. A
They look for ways to increase their productivity. Responsible employees look for ways to do jobs faster so that they will be more efficient. This increases their productivity and makes their output cost less than the output of irresponsible employees who don't care about productivity. Irresponsible employees cost the business money by coming to work late and leaving early, failing to follow directions, and overusing their benefits.

A. To build self-esteem, individuals must value their abilities above others' abilities.
B. Low self-esteem usually motivates a person to try harder and strive for success.
C. Your level of self-esteem depends on your ability to accept yourself as you are.
D. To have high self-esteem, you must be willing to overlook your faults and weaknesses.

21. C
Your level of self-esteem depends on your ability to accept yourself as you are. Self-esteem is how you feel about yourself at any given time. Your level of self-esteem can fluctuate from time to time; however, if you have an overall high level of self-esteem, you can accept yourself as you are—both your positive and negative qualities. Having good self-esteem does not mean that you overlook your faults, weaknesses and mistakes; rather, you recognize them and strive to improve over time. A person with high self-esteem has the ability to recognize others' abilities and accomplishments without feeling threatened or discouraged about their own abilities and accomplishments. Many people who have low self-esteem do not trust their own abilities and are less likely to try harder or strive for success because they fear they will fail.

77. C
Jiffy Parcel Service strives to provide the quickest, most reliable delivery service in the country. Organizational vision refers to the future a company's leaders desire to create. To achieve this vision, Jiffy's leaders and its employees must take specific actions (e.g., set goals, develop efficient processes). Management must communicate the organizational vision to employees so they understand their roles and perform their duties in ways that work toward achieving the organizational vision. Techno-Electronics set a specific sales goal. A project leader who tells their team that it is the most efficient project team in the firm is using positive reinforcement to maintain or boost morale.

A. less employee turnover.
B. more absenteeism.
C. lower health care costs.

Extrinsic motivation comes from outside the individual and their work or task. In most developed countries, people tend to have access to basic necessities like food and shelter. As a result, extrinsic motivation isn't as effective as intrinsic motivation.

A. Arnie rarely hires women to work as engineers for his company.
B. A juror believes a defendant is guilty before the trial begins.
C. Students compare grades and realize their teacher is unfair.
D. A taxi driver refuses to pick up passengers of a certain ethnicity.

23. B
A juror believes a defendant is guilty before the trial begins. Prejudice is an opinion or judgment that is based on feeling or hearsay, rather than fact. If a juror already has a feeling that the defendant is guilty, without any facts or proof before the trial begins, this is prejudice. There is no indication that the classmates who have compared grades and realized their teacher is unfair are prejudiced. If Arnie rarely hires women to work as engineers for his company, that is discrimination rather than prejudice because it is an action rather than an opinion or judgment. A taxi driver who refuses to pick up passengers of a certain ethnicity is also discriminating rather than just demonstrating prejudiced feelings.

A. provide a new vision for an organization.
B. get the business off the ground.
C. encourage overwhelmed employees.
D. lead change.

56. C
Encourage overwhelmed employees. In times of crisis, business leaders are needed to encourage overwhelmed employees and help the organization weather the storm. A crisis isn't the time to provide a new vision or to lead change—these tasks are better accomplished when the business is stable. Getting the business off the ground is an important leadership task when a business is just starting up.

59. When office arrangements require employees to share space, what do many businesses provide to offer their employees an area for privacy? 
A. Meeting rooms with doors
B. Recreational facilities
C. Individual cubicles
D. Cafeterias with small tables

59. A
Meeting rooms with doors. Space is tight in many businesses, and employees often are required to share offices or work in small cubicles that are noisy or in plain view of others. These types of office arrangements frequently create privacy problems because employees do not have quiet, secluded places to perform their tasks or make sensitive phone calls. Many businesses solve this problem by providing meeting rooms with doors that employees can use to discuss sensitive information with coworkers, talk freely with customers, or be alone to prepare important reports. Individual cubicles create privacy problems because they are usually close together and offer no barrier to noise. Cafeterias and recreational facilities often are crowded and noisy and do not provide private areas for employees.

60. Which of the following is a benefit of being exposed to conflicting viewpoints: 
A. Improved communication skills
B. Ability to win arguments easily
C. Decreased responsibility at work
D. Increased popularity in social circles

60. A
Improved communication skills. When you are able to respect and appreciate other peoples' unique viewpoints, you can have constructive dialogue with people of all backgrounds. You will not necessarily be given less responsibility at work or enjoy increased popularity in your social circles by exposing yourself to conflicting viewpoints. Being exposed to conflicting viewpoints does not give you the ability to win arguments easily.

78. Because Niyah is not a “morning person,” it takes a little while for her to feel alert and focused. Which of the following tasks is best for Niyah to work on when she first arrives at the office: 
A. Prepare a presentation
B. Read email
C. Write a research report
D. Update the departmental budget

78. B
Read email. Most people have times of the day when they feel more energetic and focused. Some people, like Niyah, need a few minutes to get going in the morning. If possible, it is best for these individuals to first work on simple or routine tasks, such as reading email or listening to voicemail messages. When Niyah feels more alert and focused, she is better prepared to work on more cognitive-based or complex tasks, such as updating the departmental budget, writing a research report, or preparing a presentation.

28. Employees who prefer to act independently and devise their own solutions will adapt more easily to which of the following management styles: 
A. Authoritarian
B. Democratic
C. Republican
D. Laissez-faire

28. D
Laissez-faire. Laissez-faire is a French term that refers to a philosophy of noninterference, and these supervisors exercise very little control over their workers. Employees who prefer to act independently, devise their own solutions, and make their own plans will adapt more easily to laissez-faire management. Employees who enjoy contributing to a team and working together to solve problems will adapt to democratic managers. Employees who are patient, accepting, and cooperative will adapt to authoritarian managers. Republican management is not a style of management.

38. Wren and Jamil are working together on a project. They decide to split up the work: Jamil is detail-oriented, so he does the research and creates the slideshow, while Wren, who is charismatic and outgoing, plans and delivers the presentation to the class. Because each team member focused on their area of expertise, they end up receiving an ‘A’ on their project. This is an example of what benefit of working in teams? 
A. Shared accountability
B. Exposure to varied skills and talents
C. Social contact
D. More creativity and innovation

38. B
Exposure to varied skills and talents. Allowing people to do what they’re good at increases the odds of success and allows everyone to perform to their best ability. If all team members focus on their areas of expertise, they will feel more comfortable, confident, and motivated to succeed, which leads to a stronger final product. While social contact, more creativity, and shared accountability are benefits of working as part of a team, they were not directly demonstrated in this example.

50. A good example of a vision is __________, while __________ is a goal. 
A. shortening customer wait time; being known for outstanding customer service
B. being the leader in your industry; adding a new product this year
C. increasing sales; increasing sales by 5%.
D. losing ten pounds; eating healthier foods

50. B
Being the leader in your industry; adding a new product this year. Visions and goals are different. A vision involves the big picture, the overarching aim of the organization or team. It is meant to provide inspiration for the future. Goals, on the other hand, are more specific, measurable, and time-bound. Therefore, being a leader in your industry is a vision because it is big-picture. Adding a new product line is a goal because it is specific and could be a small step on the way to achieving that vision. Losing ten pounds and eating healthier foods are both goals. Being known for outstanding customer service is a vision, whereas shortening customer wait time is a goal. Finally, increasing sales and increasing sales by 5% are both goals, rather than visions.

72. Which of the following best represents how ambiguity correlates with complexity: 
A. Johnny is in a situation that is too complicated to predict.
B. Pedro is in a situation where there is one right answer.
C. Angela is in a situation she has never been in before.
D. Harper is in a situation without an obvious solution.

72. A
Johnny is in a situation that is too complicated to predict. Ambiguity tends to correlate with three things: novelty, complexity, and insolubility. Complexity is the state of being intricate or complicated. Johnny being in a situation that is too complicated to predict best represents how ambiguity correlates with complexity. Angela being in a situation she has never been in before represents how ambiguity correlates with novelty (newness). Harper being in a situation without an obvious solution represents how ambiguity correlates with insolubility, meaning that there is not one single, obvious solution to a problem. Pedro being in a situation where there is one right answer does not represent ambiguity.

86. Which of the following are most likely consequences of a leader abusing their power: 
A. Decreased productivity and low turnover
B. Lowered morale and decreased productivity
C. Low turnover and increased salary
D. Increased salary and lowered morale

86. B
Lowered morale and decreased productivity. A leader who abuses their power brings down morale by causing followers to feel anxious and intimidated. This can lead to higher turnover in workplaces, since employees are unlikely to remain at a company where they feel threatened or disrespected. Productivity is also harmed when leaders abuse their power as followers lose their motivation and inspiration to do good work. Increased salary is not typically a consequence of a leader abusing their power.

A. Observe others whom you admire
B. Ask questions like, “What can I improve?”
C. Complete a personal skills inventory
D. Get input from others around you

95. B
Ask questions like, “What can I improve?” Answering questions like “What can I improve?” and “What are my career goals?” honestly and thoughtfully puts your thought process into motion and helps bring your strengths and weaknesses into clearer focus. This is a good starting point to evaluate what you do well and what you can improve. Getting input from others, observing others, and completing a skills inventory are important steps to identify strengths and weaknesses, but they typically come after asking yourself important questions.

14. To build collaborative relationships with coworkers, it is necessary for each person to 
A. change their personal opinions.
B. be willing to share information.
C. possess the same skills and attitudes.
D. develop a competitive spirit.

14. B
Be willing to share information. Collaboration involves working together in a cooperative manner. It requires honesty, trust, and a willingness to share information to accomplish common goals. It is not necessary for people to possess the same skills and attitudes or to change their values or opinions to effectively collaborate. An overly competitive attitude may hinder collaboration because people may become more interested in their own agendas rather than focusing on the group's goals.
