12. Which of the following is an example of a law: 
A. You must wait in line to check out at the grocery store.
B. You must follow the speed limit while driving.
C. Your school's dress code does not allow sleeveless tops.

12. B
You must follow the speed limit while driving. Laws are products of written statutes passed by a governing body. Speed limits are examples of traffic laws. School dress codes and bans on profane language are not examples of laws; rather, these are rules. Waiting in line to check out at the grocery store is a store policy rather than a law.

A. It does not offer shares to the general public.
B. It has a specific mission other than making a profit.
C. It can sell unlimited shares to the general public.
D. It is limited to 100 or fewer shareholders.

2. A
It does not offer shares to the general public. A private corporation, also known as a close corporation, is a type of corporation owned by a few people that does not offer its shares for sale to the general public. A "C" corporation, also known as a public corporation, can sell unlimited shares of stock to the general public— meaning there may be unlimited stockholders in just one company. A subchapter corporation, or "S" corporation, is a type of corporation that is limited to 100 or fewer shareholders, has limited shareholder liability, and requires little financial reporting. A nonprofit organization operates to accomplish a specific mission—other than to make a profit. Generally, the purpose of the organization is to help society, and income is used to fund programs and cover operational expenses.

20. If an organization is shipping goods internationally, it should be aware of __________ laws to avoid penalties and fines. 
A. export
B. import
C. civil
D. criminal

20. A
Export. Export laws regulate goods that are sent outside of a country to another nation. Therefore, if an organization is shipping goods internationally, it should be aware of export laws to avoid penalties and fines. Import laws regulate goods that are sent into a country by other countries. Civil laws deal with rights and duties of private entities, as well as possible disputes between them. Criminal laws deal with crime and the legal punishment of criminal offenses.

22. A contract is considered legally binding if 
A. the subject of the contract is ambiguous.
B. something of value is exchanged between parties.
C. only one party agrees on the offer.
D. at least one party is a business.

22. B
Something of value is exchanged between parties. A legally binding contract is any agreement that is legally enforceable by a court. In other words, if you sign a legally binding contract and don't fulfill your end of the bargain as promised in the contract, then the other party can take you to court. For a contract to be legally binding, something of value must be exchanged for something else of value. This can include money, goods, services, and promises. Both parties must agree to the offer, terms, and conditions of a contract for it to be legally binding. The subject of a legally binding contract must be clearly and unambiguously defined in the document to ensure that all parties understand what is being agreed upon. The parties in a legally binding contract can be a person or an entity (such as a business). There’s no requirement that a legally binding contract needs to include at least one business.

A. It pertains to the actions of government agencies.
B. It deals with crime and criminal offenses.
C. It deals with the rights and duties of private entities.
D. It settles possible disputes between private entities.

48. A
It pertains to the actions of government agencies. Administrative law pertains to the actions of government agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Administrative law grants these agencies certain powers, provides guidelines for the regulations they create, and defines the relationships they have with other governmental bodies. Civil law includes laws that deal with the rights and duties of private entities, as well as possible disputes between them, which include contract disputes, personal injury claims, property disputes, and civil rights violations. Criminal law deals with crime and the legal punishment of criminal offenses.

A. corporation.
B. sole proprietorship.
C. partnership.

68. A
Corporation. Corporations can be complex to form, but they provide protection for their owners because each owner's liability is limited to the amount of their investment. A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. A sole proprietorship is a type of business ownership in which only one person owns and manages the business. A licensing arrangement is a business structure that requires the authorization or permission from an owner to another entity to use trademarked, copyrighted (e.g., logo, name), or patented material for a specific activity, during a specific time period, for the profit of both parties.

A. Business-format franchise
B. Licensing agreement
C. General partnership
D. Multilevel marketing

1. B
Licensing agreement. A licensing agreement is a business structure that requires the authorization or permission from an owner to another entity to use trademarked (e.g., logo, name), copyrighted, or patented material for a specific activity, during a specific time period, for the profit of both parties. In the example, the sportswear company pays the university to use its logo, so the business arrangement involves a licensing agreement. A business-format franchise is a franchise arrangement in which the franchisee must operate under the trade name of the parent company that provides continuous assistance in setting up and operating the business. Multilevel marketing refers to a business, usually well-known, that pays commissions on sales earned to people at two or more levels. The sales representatives usually work independently of the company. A general partnership is a form of business ownership in which two or more individuals own the business, and each partner shares responsibility for the business's liabilities.

7. Before filing a civil lawsuit in court, Kwame's attorney sent a letter to Tosh's attorney. In the letter, Kwame's attorney explained why they believe they would win a lawsuit against Tosh. Kwame's attorney sent a(n) __________ letter to Tosh's lawyer. 
A. termination
B. official
C. demand
D. warning

7. C
Demand. A demand letter is a letter sent to a person informing them of a legal dispute. Demand letters are used in small-claim disputes to inform a person of the legal dispute and to ask for relief. Relief is the course of action that would satisfy someone who files a lawsuit. Generally, relief is restitution. A termination letter informs someone that they were fired from a job. An official letter is simply a formal letter. A demand letter is a step further than a warning letter. A warning letter would simply indicate a problem to the letter-reader.

A. procedural due process.
B. substantive due process.
C. the Takings Clause.
D. sovereign immunity.

49. A
Procedural due process. Procedural due process exists to ensure that individuals and businesses who are sued or charged with a crime have the opportunity to present evidence on their behalf before a court can impose a penalty. Requiring the government to go through a certain set of legal procedures before taking someone's liberty or property provides the person or business in question a greater chance of being treated fairly. Substantive due process exists to ensure that the government does not take away our fundamental rights (e.g., privacy). The Takings Clause requires the U.S. government to pay a fair price for any private property that it takes for public use. Sovereign immunity protects a federal government from lawsuits brought against it in foreign courts.

74. Which of the following is a benefit of using mediation to resolve disputes: 
A. Decisions that carry more weight
B. Unbiased third-party decision maker
C. Cost-effectiveness and efficiency
D. Higher payouts for defendants

74. C
Cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Mediation is an informal process during which two parties meet with an impartial third party to find a mutually satisfactory solution to a problem. A benefit of mediation is that it is costeffective and efficient, especially compared to going to trial. Mediation does not lead to higher payouts for the defendant. Mediation cannot impose a legally binding decision, so it does not carry more weight. Finally, while there is a third-party mediator, that person does not make decisions. Instead, they help guide the negotiation process while the two parties come to a decision on their own.

Plaintiff files a complaint. Litigation is the formal process during which legal disputes are involved. The first step of the process is when the plaintiff initiates a case and files a formal legal complaint. Then, the defendant is served with court paperwork or waives service of process, if applicable. Next, the defendant may file an answer to the complaint the plaintiff has made. Initial motions from both parties are then filed. Appeals can only be made after a decision has been reached at the conclusion of a trial.

B. partake in a formal process.
C. testify under oath.
D. control the outcome.

23. D
Control the outcome. Mediation is the process in which a neutral third party works to help opposing parties resolve a conflict, whereas arbitration calls on an uninvolved third party (called an arbitrator) to analyze the case and reach a verdict. In mediation, the mediator has no power to decide the outcome and helps the parties negotiate an outcome that is mutually satisfactory. Parties in mediation do not testify under oath. In arbitration, the parties present their cases to an arbitrator and testify under oath. The arbitrator listens to the evidence and has the power to decide the outcome. Arbitration has a clear winner or loser. Arbitration is a formal process, whereas mediation is an informal process.

B. It ends a dispute before the end of a trial.
C. It requires lawyers and courtroom procedure.
D. It is typically more expensive than going to trial.

43. B
It ends a dispute before the end of a trial. Settling a case means ending a dispute before the end of a trial. Trials are expensive, but cases that reach settlement can avoid the expense of a trial while still offering some compensation for the wrong that was committed. Settlements do not take place after a trial. Even though they can sometimes speed up the process, lawyers and courtroom procedure are not necessary to reach a settlement. Both parties must agree to the settlement.

The party that makes a formal legal complaint. Litigation is the formal process during which legal disputes are involved. The plaintiff in the litigation process refers to the person or party that initiates a case and makes a formal legal complaint. The defendant is the person or party that the plaintiff has a legal issue with. Defendants must answer the complaint and defend themselves. A judge is a public official appointed to preside over court proceedings. A jury is the body of people sworn to give a verdict in a legal case based on evidence presented in court.

13. One of the most common reasons why a defendant may choose to settle a legal dispute out of court is to 
A. avoid the high costs of going to trial.
B. earn the respect of a jury.
C. prove the defendant's innocence.
D. turn the ordeal into a public spectacle.

13. A
Avoid the high costs of going to trial. Litigation costs are often extremely high—and the outcome of a trial could be potentially more damaging to a defendant than settling out of court. Settling, however, generally involves some sort of admission of wrongdoing—even if the defendant believes it did nothing wrong. Therefore, proving the defendant's innocence is not generally a reason for settling a case out of court. Trials can also turn into public spectacles, drawing unwanted attention and potentially negative publicity to the defendant. Settling out of court is an effective way to avoid turning the case into this sort of public drama. Earning the respect of a jury could only happen via a trial, not by settling out of court.

A. letter of intent.

D. sales contract.

67. D
Sales contract. A purchase order is a form that a business fills out to order goods. Because the order indicates that the business is willing to do something (pay for the items it orders) in exchange for something else (take possession of the goods), the purchase order serves as a sales contract. An open order is a type of purchase order in which buyers place the order with the supplier that can best meet the needs or criteria (e.g., price) for a particular item. Because accounts receivable is an accounting activity that involves collecting payment for the goods and services that the business offers, a purchase order is not an accounts-receivable document. A letter of intent is a letter that declares the writer's intention to do something. A purchase order is a form rather than a letter.

Worker compensation is insurance purchased by employers to provide benefits to employees who are injured on the job. A labor union is a group of workers in the same industry or profession who have united to improve the terms and conditions under which they work. Labor union laws govern the way labor unions can organize and take action.

D. Excise tax

30. C
Capital gains tax. A capital gain is the increase in an asset's value from the time that it is purchased to the time that it is sold. The federal government charges capital gains taxes on most capital gains. A luxury tax is a tax paid on nonessential (and, in many cases, expensive) goods. An excise tax is a tax placed on a specific good. Luxury and excise taxes can be used to discourage consumption of certain products or to raise some easy money on products that the government knows people will continue to purchase, regardless of the tax. Stock sales tax is a fictitious term.

50. Which of the following is a benefit of compliance in the finance industry: 
A. It builds and maintains public trust in the financial system.
B. It eliminates all risks an organization may face.
C. It makes it easier to manipulate the market or market prices.
D. It leads to decreased regulatory scrutiny and regulation.

50. A
It builds and maintains public trust in the financial system. Financial compliance is the regulation and enforcement of laws and rules in finance, the capital markets, and the banking system. It has several benefits, including building and maintaining the public's trust in the financial system, managing risk, and reducing financial crime, among others. While financial compliance advises companies how to avoid and address risk, it does not entirely eliminate it. Financial compliance was a result of increased regulatory scrutiny and regulation because of the 2008 financial crisis; financial compliance does not lead to decreased regulatory scrutiny and regulation. The crisis led to compliance departments becoming active in risk management rather than being in simply an advisory role. Manipulating the market or market prices is considered to be an unethical financial compliance practice rather than a benefit.

Fiduciary. A fiduciary is someone who acts on behalf of another person or organization. In most cases, fiduciaries are responsible for managing their clients' financial assets and making decisions in the best interest of their clients. Because Charlotte does more than simply sell investments to her clients, she is considered a fiduciary. An accountant gathers, records, organizes, and reports financial data. A credit analyst assesses the requests of individuals and businesses applying for loans, makes reports to the loan committee, and helps decide if the requests should be granted. Institutional investors are mutual fund managers, large investment firms, and significant holding companies who invest in the stock market.

Employer-employee. In legal terms, the employer-employee relationship refers to the amount of control that a principal (e.g., employer or client) has over an agent (e.g., employee or attorney). Determining if a employeremployee relationship exists is an important consideration when addressing a business's legal issues and disputes, especially in cases that involve liability questions. Factors that determine if a employer-employee relationship exists include the nature of the agent's work, the level of the agent's control (e.g., decision-making), and the agent's level of supervision.

88. Drew, a high-ranking employee at a wealthy corporation, received word that a product his company produces will need a massive recall, which will likely result in the company's stock price falling.

A. internet fraud.
B. pump-and-dump schemes.
C. insider trading.
D. boiler room tactics.

88. C
Insider trading. Insider trading is the buying or selling of a public company's stock by an individual who has nonpublic, confidential information about the company or the stock. It also includes tipping others off when one has nonpublic, confidential information. Because Drew informed his friend of the recall before the news was made public, allowing them to sell their stock before the price decreases, Drew was partaking in illegal insider trading. Boiler room tactics are high-pressure sales tactics used by salespeople to persuade investors to purchase speculative or fraudulent securities. Internet fraud is the use of online services or software to commit cybercrime, defraud victims, and take advantage of victims. Pump-and-dump schemes attempt to boost the price of a stock or security through false, misleading, fake, or exaggerated statements or recommendations.

A. a Ponzi scheme.
B. phishing.
C. a boiler room.

6. A
A Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that lures in new investors by promising high rates of return with little to no risk. Ponzi schemes pay returns to investors from the promoter's own money or from the money paid by new investors, rather than from the actual profit earned by the scheme. Phishing is an online identity-theft scam that fools its victims into believing they are submitting sensitive, personal information (such as credit card numbers or bank passwords) to a legitimate website. Insider trading refers to the buying or selling of a security by someone who has access to nonpublic information about that security. A boiler room is a method in which scammers use high-pressure tactics on potential investors by relying on cold calls, fast talking, and vague responses to make their sales.

11. Which of the following statements about capital gains tax is true: 
A. It is due only before an investment is sold.
B. Short-term gains are taxed at one's regular income tax rate.
C. It applies to more than just capital assets.
D. Long-term gains are levied on profits held for less than a year.

11. B
Short-term gains are taxed at one's regular income tax rate. Capital gains tax is tax on earnings from the appreciation of a stock investment. Capital gains tax is owed for the tax year during which the investment is sold. Short-term capital gains tax applies if the investor owns the investment for one year or less. Short-term gains are taxed at an individual's regular income tax rate, which is higher than the tax on long-term gains. Longterm gains are levied on profits held for more than a year, not less than a year. Capital gains apply only to capital assets, such as stocks, bonds, jewelry, and real estate. Capital gains taxes are due only after an investment is sold, not before.

Implementing internal control systems to prevent fraud. Financial compliance refers to the regulation and enforcement of laws in finance and capital markets. Financial compliance ranges through the entire finance industry, from investment banking practices to retail banking practices. An example of an ethical financial compliance practice is implementing internal controls to prevent financial crimes such as fraud and money laundering.

D. offshore companies.

25. A
Flow-through shares. Flow-through shares are common tax shelters used by taxpayers to reduce their tax burdens. Corporations that issue flow-through shares are typically part of the mining industry. These companies agree to use whatever funds they receive from investors for exploration purposes—in other words, to locate new sources of oil, gold, copper, etc. Rather than writing off these funds from their corporate taxes, the companies pass the tax deductions on to their investors, who can write off their entire investments against their taxes. Offshore companies, which are also commonly used as tax shelters, are businesses that are incorporated outside the country. Government bonds are interest-bearing certificates issued by the government, which promises to pay bond owners a certain sum at a specified time. Derivatives are financial instruments whose value depends upon the value of other financial instruments (e.g., currencies, securities, commodities) or a market index.

It identifies patterns and trends in a company. Introducing compliance technology into a business has several positive impacts. This includes identifying patterns and trends in a company, which can lead to a more competent risk assessment. Compliance technology cannot and should not replace living specialists in a company. For example, a computer can analyze information and draw conclusions from it, but it is up to the specialist to determine what to do with these conclusions. Compliance technology will improve a company's overall efficiency, not reduce it. Compliance technology increases the protection of a company's private data and information and decreases the likelihood of a data breach.

Otherwise, the courts can find them guilty of negligence, and they would be charged a fine. It's not possible for hospitality and tourism businesses to avoid all risks. There is always the chance that something bad can happen. Hospitality and tourism businesses are not insurers of their customers nor do they take out insurance on each customer. Instead, they take out liability insurance that transfers risk to an insurance company. Hospitality and tourism businesses act so that they limit their responsibility for accidents.

66. Which of the following is an example of consideration in a contract: 
A. Selling an item for $500
B. Promising to make a gift
C. Putting the price in writing
D. Giving away an item worth $500

66. A
Selling an item for $500. In a contract, consideration is what one party gives or receives in exchange for something else. If a person contracts with another person to sell an item for a certain amount, the consideration is giving up the item in exchange for $500. In this situation, the buyer's consideration is the $500 paid for the item. Consideration is not putting the price in writing, promising to make a gift, or giving away an item worth $500.

22. When shipping goods internationally, businesses can avoid penalties and fines by being aware of 
A. extreme weather.
B. accounting standards.
C. export regulations.
D. the global stock market.

22. C
Export regulations. When shipping products overseas, all businesses are subject to various export regulations and can face consequences for violating these rules. By educating their employees and organizational partners about international laws and export controls, businesses can reduce the risk of penalties and fines. While businesses should be aware of extreme weather, this does not help them avoid penalties and fines. Accounting standards and the global stock market are not directly tied to international shipping—therefore, knowledge of them would not reduce the risk of penalties or fines.

51. If several countries implement tariffs on imports, global trade often decreases. To reduce the negative effects of this form of trade protectionism, countries often negotiate 
A. domestic subsidies.
B. trade agreements.
C. export limits.
D. import restrictions.

51. B
Trade agreements. Global trade is an intricate balancing act. When one or more key players in the global economy begins reducing its participation in trade, the entire economy can suffer. To reduce the negative effects of import tariffs and other trade restrictions, countries often negotiate trade agreements with one another. Trade agreements attempt to strike deals among several countries to encourage cross-country trade. Domestic subsidies are often used as a form of trade protectionism, not as a method for encouraging global trade. Export limits and import restrictions would also fall into the category of trade protectionism.
