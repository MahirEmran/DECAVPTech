Groupthink. When a person makes a poor decision out of fear of disagreeing with a group, they are
demonstrating groupthink behavior. Status quo bias refers to a preference to maintain the status quo and the
view that a change from it is a loss. Acceptance refers to a conscious decision to personally agree with a
practice instead of simply following the crowd. Critical thinking involves an analysis or assessment to make
sound judgments by viewing other viewpoints or ideas. Monique is not demonstrating acceptance or critical
thinking because she is opting to follow the crowd and is not making sound judgments in doing so.

4. C
The economy's output decreases. When the unemployment rate is high, the economy's output decreases.
When people are unemployed, they and their families have less disposable income and lower purchasing
power. This means that unemployed workers spend far less than employed workers with steady income, as
unemployed workers have less money to spend. As a result, the nation as a whole loses their contribution to the
economy in terms of buying goods and services. Unemployment also affects those workers who are still
employed, as they may be concerned about losing their jobs, feel guilty for having a job when their former coworkers are out of work, or even feel lucky to have kept their jobs. In this way, unemployment hurts employee
morale.

A Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that lures in new investors by promising high rates of
return with little to no risk. Ponzi schemes pay returns to investors from the promoter's own money or from the
money paid by new investors, rather than from the actual profit earned by the scheme. Phishing is an online
identity-theft scam that fools its victims into believing they are submitting sensitive, personal information (such
as credit card numbers or bank passwords) to a legitimate website. Insider trading refers to the buying or selling
of a security by someone who has access to nonpublic information about that security. A boiler room is a
method in which scammers use high-pressure tactics on potential investors by relying on cold calls, fast talking,
and vague responses to make their sales.

Be true to your core values, beliefs, and attitudes. Reflecting on and processing what you have learned,

they are wrong. Sometimes, you may even realize that they are right and you are wrong. Being respectful helps
you prevent offending or belittling others; reflecting on what you have learned is an internal process and does
not necessarily impact how you treat others. Reflecting on what you have learned often requires you to ask

Short-term gains are taxed at one's regular income tax rate. Capital gains tax is tax on earnings from the
appreciation of a stock investment. Capital gains tax is owed for the tax year during which the investment is
sold. Short-term capital gains tax applies if the investor owns the investment for one year or less. Short-term
gains are taxed at an individual's regular income tax rate, which is higher than the tax on long-term gains. Longterm gains are levied on profits held for more than a year, not less than a year. Capital gains apply only to

It expands the number of cost pools used to assemble overhead costs. Activity-based costing (ABC) is a
costing method that assigns overhead and indirect costs to related products and services. Essentially, ABC first
assigns costs to activities that are the real cause of overhead and then assigns costs of those activities only to
the products or services that actually demand the activities. One way in which ABC enhances the costing
process is by expanding the number of cost pools used to assemble overhead costs. Rather than accumulating
all costs in one company-wide pool, it pools costs by activity. ABC transfers overhead costs from high-volume
products to low-volume products, thus raising the unit cost of low-volume products.

Acid-test. An acid-test ratio determines whether a company has substantial short-term assets to cover its

inventory may not be converted to cash quickly. A current ratio measures a company's ability to meet current
liabilities out of current assets. A cash ratio removes many current assets when considering a business's ability
to meet its short-term goals, as it only looks at assets that are already liquid. A days sales outstanding ratio
refers to the average number of days it takes a company to collect payment after making a sale.

Capital. A capital budget typically is a request for purchases of large assets (such as property, equipment, or IT
systems) that create major demands on a company's cash flow. Capital budgets are often used to allocate
funds, set priorities, and control risks in decision-making. Because Ashley prepares a budget that serves as a
request for the purchase of a property, this scenario is an example of a capital budget. An operating budget
details the revenues and expenses associated with day-to-day operations and divides them into major
categories (such as revenues, salaries, and benefits). A cash budget ties capital and operating budgets
together and accounts for the timing of both payments and receipt of cash from revenues. Cash budgets help
businesses manage their cash flow effectively by assessing whether additional capital is required, if there is
excess capital, or whether the company needs to raise more money. A promotional budget refers to the amount
of money a business plans to spend on promoting its goods and services during a certain period of time.

It helps ensure data accuracy. Central data repositories allow for businesses to store their information and data
from different sources in a logical, organized way. Data repositories help ensure data accuracy by helping
businesses avoid data duplication, eliminate inconsistencies in data, and circumvent other problems. Data
repositories store data in one, centralized location. Central data repositories are useful for everyone, no matter
how tech-savvy one is, as they allow team members to navigate data with ease. Data repositories do not

Non-insurable risks. Within traditional risk management, an organization only looks at things that are insurable.
Enterprise risk management (ERM) goes beyond insurable risks and addresses hazards that cannot be

objects are important because decisions are made with them in mind. Once cost objects are identified, the
business can accumulate costs into a cost pool where they can be categorized. Then, the business can assign
costs to cost objects. Laying off underperforming employees is not a step a business should take when looking
to allocate costs.

Employees in different departments have different understandings of risk. A challenge to implementing
enterprise risk management (ERM) is that people in various departments have different definitions and

management is proactive, rather than traditional risk management, which is reactive. ERM does not deal with
employee relationships. Risks are not usually related to relationships among employees; there are many types
of risks related to all aspects of an organization. Legal business protections, such as patents, copyrights, and
trademarks, are included within the enterprise risk management framework.

income statement is to inform about the ability of a business to generate a profit. Balance sheets capture the
financial condition of the business at that particular moment. Balance sheets are used to estimate the liquidity,
funding, and debt position of an entity. Cash flow statements estimate when, where, and how much money will
flow into and out of a business. Therefore, cash flow statements show the nature of cash receipts and cash
disbursements.

Employee. Employee-liability exposure is the total risk businesses face from employees who have suffered a
job-related injury, illness, or other adversity. Businesses can limit this risk by training and educating their
employees on safety procedures. Training employees on safety procedures is not related to product-, fiduciary-,
or customer-liability exposure.

Changes in costs. Budget variance occurs when the amount spent by a business is greater than the budget.
There are several causes of budget variances, including changes in costs, employee fraud, improved
operations, inaccurate budgeting, and changes in the market economy, to name a few. In this scenario, the
supplier increased its prices shortly after Dana set her company's budget, meaning that the company will spend
more than initially planned. This scenario is not an example of how employee fraud, improved operations, or
inaccurate budgeting can cause budget variance.

Expert systems. Expert systems are a special kind of computer software designed to mimic the knowledge of a
human expert. Mechanics often use expert systems to diagnose trouble in a vehicle’s engine. This allows them
to fix the problem more quickly. Electronic transfer of funds is a computer-based system that allows businesses
to transfer money quickly and easily. A business might use satellite technology to conduct video conferences,
not diagnose trouble in an engine. Voice over Internet Protocol, like Zoom, connects people quickly by voice
and picture. It’s useful technology but would not necessarily help Twiggy diagnose the engine trouble.

Carefully evaluated alternatives. When a person uses a decision-making model, they can trust that they are
making a good effort to make a decision by carefully evaluating all the alternatives available. There is no way to
ensure that a decision is actually the best choice or achieves success until after the decision has been carried
out and any potential consequences have occurred. A person using a decision-making model does not
necessarily trust their intuition is right when making a decision.

Hazard. Hazard risks are potential events or situations that can cause injury or harm to people, property, or the
environment. Most hazard risks can only cause business losses, not gains. Types of hazard risks include
natural disasters, like tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, blizzards, hurricanes, and wildfires. Operational risks are
the possible events and situations that can result from employee actions, core processes, and daily business
activities. Strategic risks often concern the overall business environment, economic or political issues, or the
company’s objectives. Financial risks are possible events or situations that directly influence a company’s cash
flow.

Insider trading. Insider trading refers to the buying or selling of a security by someone who has access to
nonpublic information about that security. When said person provides "tips" to others about the security before
the information is public, it is also considered an insider trading violation. This is not an example of ethical
trading. Affinity fraud is an investment scam in which the scammer claims to be a member of the group they are
targeting (e.g., religious groups or ethnic identity). Predatory lending refers to lenders pressuring consumers
into signing loan agreements that consumers cannot afford or are not in their best interest.

The inflation rate changes over time. Inflation is an external, macroeconomic phenomenon that can have a
major impact on companies and the economy as a whole. Inflation can pose risks to businesses by altering the
habits of consumers and devaluing the business’s liquid assets. An injured employee, an inaccurate inventory
count, and budget delays are all examples of internal risks to a business.

A conflict of interest. A conflict of interest is a situation in which it is impossible to be truly impartial. Because
Theo is prioritizing his own personal gain over his client’s well-being, this is an example of a conflict of interest.
This is not an example of complying with laws and regulations or acting in good faith. A finance charge refers to
the interest charged on the outstanding balance of a credit account.

Social media post. Knowing when and how to adapt written correspondence to different audiences is a critical
business communication skill. A conversational, informal tone and slang would be most appropriate in a
company’s social media post. A report for a CEO and an industry publication would require a formal, serious
tone and potentially technical jargon—these audiences require a more professional communication style. A
company-wide email would be less formal than the publication and report but would likely avoid slang.

Conducting internal audits. Internal audits are an example of effective corporate governance because they
promote transparency and accountability. Audits ensure smooth day-to-day operations, clarify the chain of
command, and measure organizational performance. Hosting brainstorming sessions, promoting executives,
and complying with external regulations are corporate governance processes, but they do not promote
transparency.

Variable. Cost accounting is a form of managerial accounting that looks to capture a company's total cost of
production by assessing costs such as variable, fixed, and operating costs. Cost accounting helps businesses
make fully informed decisions. Variable costs are costs tied directly to a company's level of production.
Operating costs are associated with the day-to-day operations of a business. Fixed costs are costs that don't
vary depending on the level of production. Indirect costs are costs that cannot directly be linked to a product.

It gives businesses a competitive advantage. A financial management information system (FMIS) is simply the
automation of financial operations. Businesses with an FMIS have a competitive advantage over businesses
that do not, as it leverages the power of information technology to bring more productivity and, thus, more
satisfaction to the customer. An FMIS helps businesses stay one step ahead of their competition. An FMIS
allows for integration, helps with planning, and increases efficiency. While it may help businesses with decisionmaking, an FMIS does not make decisions for businesses.

Identity. Managing information appropriately is essential for business success because it preserves
organizational identity and history. Information regarding copyrights, patents, trademarks, etc., must be
managed properly. Managing trademark and patent information doesn’t necessarily help a business preserve its
inventory, customers, or stocks.

Treat the customer with fairness. Even though the customer is being rude and disrespectful, Mateo can model
ethical behavior by treating the customer with fairness. Mateo can make the customer leave the store or tell
them they are being rude, but doing either is not necessarily modeling ethical behavior. Being disrespectful and
yelling back to the customer are not ways to model ethical behavior.

Marginal. Marginal benefit refers to the benefit experienced when adding one extra unit, while marginal cost is
the cost associated with adding one extra unit. Therefore, a marginal analysis is the process of comparing the
marginal benefit to the marginal cost to determine if adding one extra unit is worth it for a business. In this
scenario, the clothing manufacturer is conducting a marginal analysis because it is comparing the benefits and
costs of expanding its operations by adding another product line. A SWOT analysis is a marketing tool that
investigates a business’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in an organized fashion. A
feasibility analysis involves examining such factors as demand, costs, competition, capital investment required,
and potential profit of a product or service to determine how it will fit into the product mix. A cash flow analysis is
the process of determining the amount of cash a business has to work with at any given time.
