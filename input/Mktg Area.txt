1. A
By interpreting it correctly. Marketing-information managers can protect the integrity of the information they
collect by interpreting it correctly and not manipulating it in such a way that it agrees with a predetermined
conclusion. Protecting the integrity of marketing information is sometimes difficult because researchers often
can make the information support either side of an issue depending on how they interpret it. Most researchers
try to interpret the information correctly because consumers are sometimes suspicious of research findings that
seem to support the opinions of the business that sponsors the research. Researchers do not protect the
integrity of marketing information by reviewing it frequently, publishing it openly, or organizing it logically.

The average U.S. male buys frozen pizza four times every 30 days. A measure of central tendency is a term
used in marketing research that indicates the center of distribution. The number represents a value derived by a
sample taken that falls between the lowest and highest value rating, which can be measured as mode, mean, or
median. A mean is an average. The mean is determined by adding the sum of the data values and dividing by
the number of values in the set (e.g., sample size). Specific distances between two points, members of a swim
team, and increases in gasoline taxes state exact values and do not necessarily represent or state data in terms
of averages.

Opt-in email. Opt-in email refers to the electronic promotional messages that are sent with a recipient's
permission and allows the recipient to request removal from the subscriber list at any time. Opt-in email is a
good way for a business to promote goods and services because it allows the business to send information to
customers who request the information. This method is also a quick and inexpensive way to send promotional
messages. Unsolicited junk mail refers to promotional messages that customers do not request. Cookies are
text files that are put on a website visitor's computer hard drive and then later retrieved during subsequent visits
to the site in order to track internet behavior. Instant messaging is the ability to send, receive, and respond to
computer messages in real-time.

before you go to work are ways in which you maintain your personal hygiene, which affects your personal
appearance. When you follow a routine to maintain your hygiene, you often feel better about yourself and your
appearance, which can make you feel more confident at work. Your posture refers to the way you hold your
body when sitting, standing, etc. Good diet and nutrition involves eating foods that are healthy for you. Your
wardrobe is your clothing.

Types of products being purchased. Businesses maintain a variety of records about the quantities and types of
products that customers are purchasing. These records are usually known as sales records. By analyzing past
sales records, businesses can determine what customers are buying, when they are buying, and how much
they are buying. This helps a business forecast future sales so it can be prepared to offer the products that
customers want. Businesses do not maintain customer sales records that contain information about the
discounts offered by manufacturers, the cost of paying commissioned salespeople, or the suppliers that provide
the goods.

Providing information to activists to share with others. Word-of-mouth promotion involves customers who tell
others about their satisfaction with the business. Amplified word-of-mouth promotion involves the use of
proactive efforts (campaigns) in which the business provides specific information to customers (activists) to
pass along to their friends, family, and business contacts. On the other hand, organic word-of-mouth promotion
occurs naturally. Because customers are satisfied with the business and its products, they tell others about this
satisfaction in the course of normal conversation. For example, if a business shows a sincere interest in the
customer by asking for feedback, taking actions to ensure customer loyalty, or improving products, the
customer is likely to share those positive experiences with others.

Who pays the transportation charges. When placing orders with suppliers, businesses usually negotiate who
pays the transportation charges. In some cases, businesses prefer to pay the transportation charges and own
the goods while they are in transit. In other cases, it might be better for the business to have the supplier pay
the charges and own the goods until they are delivered to the business. Because transportation charges may
be high, negotiating who pays them is often a key factor when placing an order. Businesses usually are not
concerned with which transportation service is used, who prepares the goods for shipment, or which warehouse
is the most modern.

Coordinate a regional advertising campaign. Channel members are all of the businesses and individuals that
assist in moving goods and services from the producer to the consumer. In many situations, producers will
assist other channel members (e.g., dealers, distributors, retailers) in sales promotions. One way to assist
channel members planning a sales promotion in a certain area is by providing resources (e.g., money, product
samples) to develop an advertising campaign. The goal of the advertising campaign is to communicate
information about the sales promotion to consumers in order to stimulate interest and sales. The producer may
provide assistance by developing new products and identifying market trends, but these activities do not relate
to a specific sales promotion. An accounting system refers to the methods and procedures a business uses in
handling its financial information.

The policyholder can borrow the policy's cash value. A whole life insurance policy builds cash value as the
policyholder pays premiums at regular intervals. If, at some point, the policyholder needs a loan, they can
borrow the cash value of the policy. Universal life insurance combines death benefits with an investment and
savings plan that earns interest at current market rates. Whole life insurance rates are higher than term
insurance rates because term insurance only pays death benefits if the policyholder dies during the set period
of time covered by the policy.

Evaluated. An effective budget is one that is evaluated regularly. The real value of a budget comes in using it to
assess the company's progress in achieving its goals. A budget must be evaluated from time to time to move
the business forward. Budgets should not be optimistic; rather, they should be realistic. It's important to base
budgets on realistic estimates. If a business isn't honest with its budget, the budget won't be very helpful.
Because budgets are estimates, it's crucial that they remain flexible. There will always be factors outside a
business's control that may require a change in the budget. Budgets shouldn't be secretive; instead, they should
be clearly communicated with all employees. When each person in the company is aware of their effect on the
company's profits, they will be more motivated to be cost-conscious.

information about Marissa's financial resources, her level of self-confidence, or her ability to effectively solve

Causal. Marketing research that focuses on cause and effect and tests “what if?” theories is called causal

research include test marketing, allowing customers to shop in a simulated store and recording their actions,
and conducting a clinical trial for a new medication. Exploratory research collects information to help the
business define its issue, situation, or concern and decide the direction in which to go to address it. Descriptive
research (also referred to as statistical research) gathers specific information related to an identified issue,
situation, or concern.

grades and realized their teacher is unfair are prejudiced. If Arnie rarely hires women to work as engineers for

While some businesses view entertainment as a way to build positive customer relationships, others view it as
favoritism or bribery. By developing entertainment guidelines for their salespeople, businesses can clearly
communicate acceptable and unacceptable entertainment activities. A promotional budget is a forecast of the

Using tamper-resistant packaging. Many businesses produce products that might be harmful to consumers if

with, which warns them not to buy the products. Using tamper-resistant packaging is an ethical procedure that
businesses follow in an effort to protect their products and ensure the safety of their customers. Products
usually are not wrapped in plain paper. Placing informative commercials on TV and explaining the new

products and offering them to customers as one product. Usually, the bundled products are offered for one, allinclusive price. An example is a business selling a computer, a printer, and ink cartridges as a unit. In many
cases, the bundle is less expensive than the cost of each item sold separately. Sometimes, the products can
only be purchased as a unit and are not available separately. A lumber company selling wood chips as smallanimal bedding is an example of selling by-products. A theme park charging admission and then selling ride
tickets is an example of two-part pricing. A garden shop discounting prices of seasonal merchandise is an
example of adjusting prices.

Credit. There are different kinds of credit accounts that allow customers to buy now and pay later. These
include budget accounts, which are usually short-term credit arrangements, but the sales are not referred to as

in which the customer does not take possession of the good or service until all payments have been made.

not speak as clearly and specifically as he would like. He can also tailor his own remarks to better suit the
Chinese style of communicating, instead of the clear and explicit method of communicating that he is used to in

By identifying consumers' wants and needs. The marketing concept is a philosophy of conducting business that
is based on the belief that all business activities should be aimed toward satisfying consumer wants and needs
while achieving company goals. Marketing research helps the business implement the marketing concept by
providing it with information about what consumers want, need, and are likely to buy. Marketing research cannot
solve a business's problems or prevent financial losses. The business sets its own goals which may or may not
be based on marketing-research information.

Snowball sampling. Snowball sampling, also called referral sampling, is a method in which researchers ask
respondents to help them identify and recruit additional respondents for the study. It is useful for target
populations that are very small, specific, or hard to reach. Cluster sampling is a probability sampling method in
which researchers divide the target population into non-overlapping subpopulations that are determined by
geography and then randomly sample each one. Stratified random sampling is a probability sampling method in
which researchers break the target population down into non-overlapping groups and draw simple random
samples from each one. Convenience sampling is a non-probability sampling method in which researchers
choose respondents based on opportunity.

Meeting rooms with doors. Space is tight in many businesses, and employees often are required to share
offices or work in small cubicles that are noisy or in plain view of others. These types of office arrangements
frequently create privacy problems because employees do not have quiet, secluded places to perform their
tasks or make sensitive phone calls. Many businesses solve this problem by providing meeting rooms with
doors that employees can use to discuss sensitive information with coworkers, talk freely with customers, or be
alone to prepare important reports. Individual cubicles create privacy problems because they are usually close
together and offer no barrier to noise. Cafeterias and recreational facilities often are crowded and noisy and do

facilitator helps keep the members of the group brainstorming session on track. This person keeps order,

Customers changing their habits. The changing nature of the marketing environment brings with it many
opportunities for businesses. One of the purposes of conducting a situational analysis is to identify possible
opportunities in the business environment. An example of a possible opportunity is a change in customers'
habits. If an analysis indicates that customers are buying more of one type of product and that the trend will
continue, a business can take advantage of the change by providing that type of product. However, to be
prepared to take advantage of such opportunities, a business first must analyze the environment to determine
exactly what those opportunities are. A situational analysis also indicates possible threats to the business.
Examples of threats include suppliers raising their prices and a decline in economic conditions. Increases in
operating expenses is an internal problem.

Conducting exploratory research. Exploratory research is marketing research that collects information to help
the business define its issue, situation, or concern and decide which direction to go in order to address it.
Surveys that consist of open-ended questions require respondents to provide more than a "yes" or "no" answer.
An open-ended question is a type of unstructured question that allows a respondent the opportunity to express
opinions, state issues, and provide ideas. By obtaining this type of in-depth, qualitative information, the
researcher may be able to define the problem and determine in which direction to proceed with the research.
Long and technical surveys tend to overwhelm the respondents, so open-ended questions may not be
answered fully, if at all. The use of open-ended questions yields subjective responses that are based on
opinions and personal feelings.

A weakness of the private enterprise system. Although private enterprise systems are economically productive,
they do have some negative aspects. One of these is that property and income are not equally distributed. The

not have access to higher education, training, and skills. Charlie's family does not have the money to pay for
him to go to college, so it was difficult for him to improve his financial standing. Val, on the other hand, was born

more difficult. Closed-ended questions offer limited response options to inquiries or statements. Forced-choice
questions are closed-ended questions. A scale is a method of measurement that assigns range of possible
responses. For example, a scale that is often used to assess a respondent's feeling regarding a statement

provide information about repeat customers. Sales strategies are the activities salespeople use to sell products.
A sales commission rate is a form of compensation paid to salespeople that is based on a certain percentage of
sales volume or sales dollars.

Sort by zip code. Database software programs allow businesses to arrange customer information according to
various criteria. Once the names, addresses, and other information are entered in the computer, the business
can sort the data alphabetically, by zip code, or using any other criteria. For example, a business might sort the
list by birthday in order to send each customer a personalized card. A business might use a spreadsheet
program to calculate monthly profit, a word-processing program to prepare sales letters, and a communications
program to write email messages.

Odds of winning. To operate ethically, businesses that sponsor sweepstakes and contests are required to
inform potential participants about the odds of winning. By providing this type of information, businesses are not
misleading or deceiving customers about the possibility of winning. Customers have the right to know what their
chances of winning are to decide if they want to participate. A rebate is a return of part of the price a customer
pays for a good or service. A coupon is a certificate or part of an advertisement entitling the holder to a reduced
purchase price. A sample is a small amount of a product.

It's reliable. Quantitative sales forecasting is advantageous because it's reliable—based on hard facts and
numerical data. However, it isn't cheap to undertake quantitative sales forecasting. Quantitative sales
forecasting doesn't provide the "human touch" that qualitative forecasting does, and it's not ideal for new
businesses, since they don't have a lot of information to go on.

Preprint UPC data on packages. The Universal Product Code (UPC) label is encoded with product information,
such as price, brand, size, etc., to be read by an electronic scanner. Technology allows manufacturers to
preprint this data on packages before shipping them to businesses. The preprinted data simplifies the pricemarking function because the business does not need to mark a price on each product. The UPC data contain
the necessary pricing information. Exchanging data electronically, shipping goods directly to businesses, and
receiving orders automatically are not ways that technology simplifies the price-marking function.

Sometimes unclear. Ethics refer to beliefs and values that guide a person's behavior. Because each person's
idea about acceptable behavior can vary, many industries and professions develop standards, or written
guidelines, that define what is deemed ethical behavior and what constitutes acceptable business practices.
Ethical standards help clarify appropriate behavior so that professionals understand what is expected of them
and what they need to do to follow the standards. Ethics are not always apparent or understood. However, they
are often followed.

Setting realistic goals through prioritization. Prioritizing is one of the most important methods for balancing work
and personal life. Prioritization involves ranking responsibilities in terms of urgency and importance, and taking
care of the most important first. Procrastination is never an effective method for completing work. However, it
would also be unwise to avoid personal responsibilities until your work is completely finished. A better method
would be to set goals and to prioritize. You do not need to accept the fact that you won't be able to spend time
with your family; with effective time management, anyone can successfully balance their work and home life.

Integrity. To help ensure ethical business operations, businesses should make integrity an important
characteristic to look for in employees. This means that businesses should attempt to hire honest individuals
with high moral character. Physical fitness, kindness, and attention to detail will not necessarily make an
employee more ethical.

Complementary and more or less equal in stature. Two brands join forces as "co-brands" for the purpose of
increasing sales and market share for both. Each benefits from the other's brand equity. Co-branding works
best when the two brands "go together," or are complementary, serve similar markets, and are essentially
equal. The co-branding arrangement of Starbucks and Barnes & Noble exemplifies co-branding principles and
has been extremely successful. Successful co-branding does not require that the brands be in the same
industry segment. The two brands should actually not be competitors, nor must they be owned by the same
parent company.
