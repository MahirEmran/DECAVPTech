Subculture. Deion and his colleagues are considered a subculture—a secondary group within a dominant
organizational culture. An organizational culture refers to the customs, traditions, and habits of employees
working together at a particular firm. Simply put, an organizational culture is the overall culture of the entire
company, while a subculture is a smaller culture within that organizational culture. A collectivist society is a
society in which people are integrated into strong, loyal groups, such as extended families. Although a
collectivist society strongly relies on groups, it is not the term used within organizations. A committee is an
appointed group of people that is dedicated to a specific matter. There is no indication that Deion and his
colleagues are members of a committee.

2. C
Credibility. Credibility is believability. It is critical that marketers ensure the information they manage is
believable. Otherwise, no one will trust the information, and it won’t be useful. Marketers can establish credibility
by using quality research methods, being open about those methods, and backing up the research with
transparent, objective analysis. Naomi is not establishing competition, privacy, or adaptability in this scenario.

3. C
Interviews. Qualitative data are those that rely on subjective judgment to evaluate quality. Since interviews do
not necessarily provide any empirical data and are based on person-to-person interaction, subjective judgement
is required to derive information. Sales projections, test grades, and time logs are all examples of quantitative
data.

4. B
Consider the cost and value of market research. Marketers that use good marketing research methods consider
the cost and value of market research. This means that in addition to determining the costs of research,
marketers ensure the results are valuable enough for management to make decisions on the results of their
research. Good marketing research methods use the scientific method, are innovative and creative, and use
multiple methods for collecting data.

Resources. A resource is any item that is used to accomplish another activity, such as equipment, supplies, and
time. You need resources for all types of projects—even the simplest project. Without resources, you would not
be able to achieve the project goal. Principles are standards. Scope is what a project will and will not include.
An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations,

Investors. An investor is someone who puts money into a company and expects returns—which makes them an
important audience for public-relations (PR) specialists. Investors typically only invest in companies they
perceive as being credible with trustworthy reputations. While PR specialists might communicate with
employees, owners, and company competitors, it’s probably less important that they stress the company’s

Ask the more important items earlier. When developing a questionnaire, put the more important items earlier in
the questionnaire. This will increase the likelihood that respondents will answer the questions while they are
focused. Sensitive items, such as demographic questions, are better later in the questionnaire because
respondents will have already completed most of the survey and will be more likely to answer them. Putting
sensitive questions early may force respondents to put their guard up. Questions should be phrased using
positive language rather than negative language. Questionnaires should only ask about one idea at a time
rather than multiple.

Grassroots marketing. Grassroots marketing is a ground-up approach to marketing that aims to target smaller,
specific groups in nontraditional channels. In this case, Abdoulaye is targeting the local community, and—rather
than creating a traditional, formal advertisement or commercial—he is enlisting friends to help promote his
business. Exploratory research is marketing research that collects information to help the business define its
issue, situation, or concern and decide how to proceed with its research. Abdoulaye is simply promoting his
business, not seeking to solve an issue or answer a question. Paradigm innovation is a type of innovation that is
a significant change in the way a product is viewed by users and society at large. Abdoulaye's promotion

Once established, sales are usually the primary source of cash flowing into a business. Cash flow is the

the primary source of cash flowing into the business. For example, a music store receives payments from the
sale of instruments, equipment, and supplies. It also receives money for services such as lessons and repairs.
Cash flow is calculated by subtracting—not dividing—total cash paid out from total cash receipts. Even

It is how people use the 24 hours in their day. Time management refers to how people use the 24 hours in their
day to effectively accomplish goals. In many ways, however, the term “time management” is misleading. Time
itself is not under our control, but our actions are. If we learn to act in a way that makes the most of our time,
then we are using the resource wisely. Another misconception is that time management requires a lot of extra
work. Sure, you might have to get used to a few new things at first, like setting goals and determining priorities,
but in the end you’ll find that spending just a few minutes a day on time management can save you many hours
and help you become much more efficient. Time management can help with both short-term and long-term

Being the leader in your industry; adding a new product this year. Visions and goals are different. A vision
involves the big picture, the overarching aim of the organization or team. It is meant to provide inspiration for the

your industry is a vision because it is big-picture. Adding a new product line is a goal because it is specific and
could be a small step on the way to achieving that vision. Losing ten pounds and eating healthier foods are both
goals. Being known for outstanding customer service is a vision, whereas shortening customer wait time is a
goal. Finally, increasing sales and increasing sales by 5% are both goals, rather than visions.

Landscaping business. Most landscaping businesses perform various yard maintenance tasks that would
require a lawn mower and would therefore receive the most utility from owning a lawn mower. Most movie
theaters, clothing retailers, and furniture stores do not offer landscaping or yardwork services; therefore, it

Executive summary. A marketing plan is a set of procedures or strategies for attracting the target customer to a
business. Most marketing plans typically include the following sections: executive summary, situational analysis,
desired target market, marketing objectives, marketing strategies and programs, financial plans, performance
and implementation, and appendix. The executive summary serves as an introduction, as it allows the reader to
understand the purpose of the marketing plan. It should include background information about the organization,
its mission statement, a brief introduction to the organization’s management team or the marketing team, and a
brief overview of the plan’s highlights and objectives. An organization's mission statement is not included in the
situational analysis, desired target market, or financial plans of a marketing plan.

Direct. Direct marketing is a form of marketing where marketers work to get specific, measurable action from a
targeted group of consumers, often by phone or email. Indirect marketing is marketing where a business is not
explicitly trying to market a product to a consumer, which would not be the case via phone or email. Permissionbased marketing is any marketing strategy that has the consent of the target audience, which is not necessarily
the case with direct marketing. Relationship marketing is a strategy in which businesses spend time with current
and prospective clients outside the office setting to enhance the partnership.

Social media. Technology has greatly changed the promotional landscape. For example, digital technology
such as social media—electronic communications through which users build communities, network, share

direct mail, and billboards are examples of traditional marketing, which doesn’t typically rely on digital
technology.

Loss of privacy. Many employees prefer to keep their personal and professional lives separate. However,
excessive use of social media can make that very difficult. Having a large social media presence can result in
personal information being circulated in the workplace. Workplace injuries are unlikely to result from social
media use since there are rarely physical consequences of social media use. Burnout, or exhaustion and stress
caused by difficulties at one’s work, is usually caused by an increased workload or a dissatisfaction with one’s
responsibilities. It is not typically directly caused by social media use. Ambush marketing is a promotional
technique where a non-sponsoring business tries to associate with an event. It is not related to workplace
consequences of social media use.

They often lead to an imbalance of supply and demand. Price controls refer to the legal minimum or maximum
prices set for specified goods. A potential disadvantage of price controls is that they can often lead to an
imbalance of supply and demand. When prices are too low, there may not be enough supply, which thereby
increases demand. This can lead to shortages (rather than eliminate them) and illegal markets. Two
advantages of price controls are that they prevent producers from price gouging and they keep companies from
developing monopolies.

Job specialization. Job specialization is a type of division of labor where employees specialize in certain tasks in
order to perform their jobs more efficiently. Since each of Murray’s employees are becoming experts in specific
roles, they are specializing. Market segmentation is the division of a market into smaller subgroups. The scalar
principle refers to creating authority that flows in a clear, continuous line. The principle of unity of command

What problem are we solving? Brainstorming is one technique for generating product/business ideas.
Brainstorming questions are often open-ended or exploratory, and they encourage imaginative thinking. ‘What

(yes or no) question that isn’t relevant to generating product/business ideas. ‘Where can we cut corners?’ is not

Decline. A product’s decline stage occurs once it starts decreasing in popularity, after the product has reached
maturity. Sometimes, products just become outdated. Better products come along that meet the same customer
needs and wants. This is why the decline stage of a certain product often coincides with the growth stage of a
new product in the same category. A classic example of this involves traditional film cameras. After digital
cameras were introduced to the market, their popularity exploded. Traditional film cameras were sent into a
quick decline. Film cameras are not in the growth stage, maturation stage, or introduction stage of the product
life cycle.

Precise. Survey questions should be as clear and precise as possible, so that the reader can better
comprehend the questions and accurate data can be collected. Survey questions should not be vague or
complex so the reader is not confused about what the question is asking. Survey questions are used as datacollection tools, so whether they are sympathetic or not is irrelevant.

Ask questions like, “What can I improve?” Answering questions like “What can I improve?” and “What are my
career goals?” honestly and thoughtfully puts your thought process into motion and helps bring your strengths
and weaknesses into clearer focus. This is a good starting point to evaluate what you do well and what you can
improve. Getting input from others, observing others, and completing a skills inventory are important steps to
identify strengths and weaknesses, but they typically come after asking yourself important questions.

Itemized. An itemized deduction is an expense that can be subtracted from an individual’s or company’s adjusted
gross income. Tax payers typically choose between a standard or itemized deduction, but in the case of charitable
donations, they must choose the itemized deduction. Charitable donations do not have to be donated in cash to be
tax deductible. Donations can also take the form of property and services. Deductible donations can exceed $100,000
as long as they are less than 60% of adjusted gross income. Charitable donations must be given to nonprofit or
volunteer organizations to be deductible.

Engagement. Social media analytics are used to measure a company’s social media performance, typically measured
through engagements. Engagements are simply a measure of how much and how often a target audience interacts
with a person or organization’s content online. Inflation is an economic measurement that is not tied directly to social
media. Sales are typically not measured on social media; companies calculate sales internally. Marketers have no
need to measure people; their objectives are to bring value to a company via promotion, pricing, product
development, and many other responsibilities.

Situation analysis. A situation analysis is a determination of a firm’s current business situation and the direction in
which the business is headed. A sales forecast is a prediction of future sales over a specific period of time. Sales
forecasts are helpful to a marketer when setting up the marketing budget, planning products, and determining the
product mix. A promotional strategy is a method used to advertise, promote, and sell its products/services. Risk
reduction is a risk management technique that involves reducing the financial consequences of a loss.

99. B
Financial risk. The better managed a business’s products and services are, the less exposure the business has to
financial risk from failed products, lost sales, and inability to meet the competition. A business’s sales and profits will
improve if it is offering the products and services its target market wants and needs. When a business’s sales and
profits improve, its market share and ability to beat the competition may also improve. When a business takes the
time to develop and market appropriate products, it can develop many new customers (which can also translate into
greater sales, profits, and market share).

Notice/Awareness. The Notice/Awareness principle states that the privacy policy should let customers know what
information is being collected, if providing their information is required or voluntary, who is collecting their information,
who could potentially receive their information, how their information will be used, and how the privacy of their
information will be protected. Access/Participation states that customers should be able to view and verify their
information with ease. Choice/Consent encourages businesses to give their customers certain options in how their
information will be used. Integrity/Security refers to keeping customer information safe and private.
