1. C
It requires collateral. Secured business lines of credit require collateral, or anything of value belonging to the
borrower which is pledged to the lender to guarantee that the loan will be repaid. When securing a line of credit,
the lender places a lien on the collateral, meaning the lender has the legal right to take the borrower's asset if
they stop making payments. Secured business lines of credit are easier to get approved than unsecured loans.
Unsecured lines of credit don't require collateral, which makes it riskier for the lender. Because of this,
unsecured loans often come with higher interest rates.

Prioritizing customer feedback. Companies that are customer-focused have established cultures that aim to
meet all of their customers' needs and earn customer satisfaction. In addition, they aim to develop close
relationships with their customer base and create a customer-focused strategy. Companies create customerfocused strategies by prioritizing customer feedback, delivering personalized experiences, and enabling
employees to go above and beyond. In addition, customer-focused companies are proactive (not reactive) when
communicating company changes.

Focus on proving the accuracy of financial statements. An external audit looks at the accuracy of a company's
financial statements as well as any other practices that could confirm the truthfulness of budget statements.
Internal audits focus on a specific area of a company, measure current performance, and look for areas of
improvement. Internal audits are conducted by someone within the company on the company's behalf, while
external audits are usually conducted by a third party.

Share a plan of action. A proposal is a document that details a plan of action, an idea, or a request for funding;
provides a solution to a problem; or suggests a change in operations. By writing proposals, business employees
are providing information to management that will help management make decisions. While they might write
proposals that deal with the grievance procedure, employees do not write proposals to air grievances.
Employees do not write proposals to request a raise; rather, they may write a proposal to request funding for a
project. Proposals are not intended to analyze a project's progress.

unbiased information about your business and therefore should probably not be asked to help with a SWOT

Gaining buy-in is an important aspect of change management. When a change occurs, it is important to get
everyone involved to buy into it. One way to do this is to tell people how the change will benefit them, as the

successful. Changes do not only impact people at the top of a company; they usually impact many or most of
the people at a company. Change can negatively affect a company if not managed well, but that is not
illustrated in this example.

It is cost effective. Direct marketing refers to forms of advertising that seek a specific, measurable action from a
targeted group of consumers, using direct mail, telemarketing, emails, etc., that are sent directly to a
consumer’s home or business. Direct marketing is cost effective, as it allows companies to target their audience
in a specific way and reach them directly while not having to pay a retailer a percentage of sales. Another
advantage of direct marketing is that it allows companies to include a personal touch in their marketing, as they
can control their interactions more effectively. A disadvantage of direct marketing is that it can lead to consumer
overload. Another disadvantage is that it must conform to legal regulations, as regulations change often and
businesses that don't adhere to changes can face stiff penalties and fines.

refers to promotional techniques that are unconventional, low-cost, and aim to attract consumers’ attention.
Grassroots marketing is the process of increasing interest in a product, brand, or idea with the use of a targeted
and highly specific audience. Cause marketing involves a collaboration between a nonprofit organization and a
for-profit business for a common benefit.

Supply and demand. Factors affecting selling price vary from business to business. Common factors include
supply and demand, economic conditions, competition, and costs. Supply and demand are determined by what

Because it offers customers complementary products. A business may expand its product mix by adding

a variety of accessories to go along with its iPhone, including cases, screen covers, and chargers. A company
might remove a product from its product mix (contraction) because it has lost appeal to customers. A company
may choose to alter the products in its product mix to help limit production costs, as altering existing products is
less expensive than developing a new product. Attracting a new target market is a reason why companies might

Bring in the right people. One way an entrepreneur can adapt to a changing business environment is to bring in

talented individuals that can help lighten their workload while also pushing the company forward. It is important
for businesses to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to change. Businesses can be proactive by
planning ahead, watching market trends, seeking out information, and asking for help. Rather than accepting
advice from everyone and anyone, entrepreneurs should be cautious about who they're getting advice from and
should only seek advice from the right people. Entrepreneurs should view challenges as opportunities for
growth or puzzles to solve rather than obstacles. Reframing challenges in this way can make it more
manageable for entrepreneurs and their team when adapting to change.

Reduce; maximize. Harvesting is a strategy in which a company continues to offer a declining product but
reduces its costs as much as possible. Therefore, businesses that use a harvest strategy reduce spending on
an established, yet declining, product to maximize profits. Harvesting is typically used toward the end of a
product's life cycle when it is deemed that further investment will not boost the product's revenue. It is also used
on outdated products while profits are reinvested into newer models or technologies.

Determine the purpose. A market analysis is a systematic study of a specific market. Companies typically
conduct market analysis to determine their target market, understand customers' buying habits, and consider
their competition, among other reasons. When conducting a market analysis, the first step a business should
take is to determine the purpose of the study. Before starting any market research, it is important for businesses
to decide on the purpose of their study and whether it is for internal or external purposes. Once companies do
this, then they can look at industry standards, pinpoint target customers, consider their competition, etc. One of
the final steps of a market analysis is to put it into action.

Additional help. It is important for startup businesses to understand the advantages and disadvantages that
come with bringing on a new employee. One advantage of hiring a new employee is that they provide additional
help, which can allow the startup to better divvy up its workload and increase efficiency. Increased profits and
happier customers are not necessarily a result or advantage of hiring a new employee. Onboarding and training
are advantages for a new employee at a startup, as they educate the employee and get them up to speed on
job duties and how the company operates. However, onboarding and training could be a disadvantage for a
startup due to the time commitment.

Returning. There are five essential functions of supply chain management (SCM): planning, sourcing, making,

element of supply chain management. SCM seeks to create a seamless path of products back through a supply
chain, from customers to distributors, manufacturers, or even suppliers. This is called reverse logistics. The
returning function is unique because it serves a slightly different purpose than planning, sourcing, making, and
delivering. Supply chain management’s ultimate goal is to meet customer demand, but the goal of returning—or
reverse logistics—is to regain product value. Networking, optimizing, and recruiting are not essential functions

Realistic and competitive. No single factor makes an effective price. Marketers must keep a number of
characteristics in mind when setting effective prices. These include being realistic, flexible, and competitive.
Customers associate price with quality—if the price is high, the quality is high; if the price is low, the quality is
low. So, businesses must set prices that are realistic to customers—neither too high nor too low. Because
pricing is a tug-of-war and a constant quest for balance, businesses must be willing to adjust their prices as
necessary, being flexible—not rigid. Additionally, when a similar product is offered by competitors, a business
needs to be aware of the prices others are charging. If not, the business will probably lose customers because
its prices are not competitive. Effective prices are not always popular.

Commercial loan. A commercial loan is a debt-based funding agreement between a financial institution (such as

Jonathan provided collateral and promised to pay back the money, he most likely received a commercial loan.
Personal seed money is money from the business owner or owners. Angel investors and venture capitalists

financial, and compliance risk. This scenario is an example of operational risk, which threatens the day-to-day
activities required for a company to operate. Security risk threatens a company's physical or digital assets, such

It is more precise than mass marketing. Segment marketing is the classification of customers into similar groups
to appeal to one or more individual segment(s). Segment marketing works because finding out what customers
need—and meeting that need—is at the heart of the marketing concept. Plus, when it comes to determining
customers’ needs, segment marketing is more precise than mass marketing—designing products and directing
marketing activities to appeal to the whole market. A disadvantage of segment marketing is that it takes more
resources to pull it off successfully. Another disadvantage is that the product is usually more complex,
potentially making it more difficult to produce—and requiring more creativity during design and more money
during production. Mass marketing communicates a broad message to a large audience, not segment

Borrowing money from family or friends is a common way for startups to obtain capital. Many startups receive

more difficult for startups to receive funding than established businesses, not the other way around. It is
common for startup owners to invest some of their own money into their business. Government grants are a
great way for startups to receive funding, as there are several federal grant opportunities for small businesses.

Product differentiation. A unique selling proposition (USP) is an attribute of your product or brand that separates
your business from competitors. Marketers use USPs as part of their overall positioning and product
differentiation strategies, which make a product appear different from similar products on the market. For
example, Amazon’s two-day shipping promise has set it apart from other e-commerce sites and has made it
one of the most successful companies in the world. Bundling is a marketing strategy that involves offering
several products for sale as one combined product. Relationship marketing is a strategy in which businesses
spend time with current and prospective clients outside the office setting to enhance the partnership. Trading up
is a product-mix strategy in which a business adds a higher priced product or product line to its product mix.
Relationship marketing, trading up, and bundling are not necessarily related to USPs.

It completely overhauls key business processes. Business process redesign (BPR) is a complete overhaul of a
company's key business processes with the goal of improving key performance measures such as cost
reduction and return on investment. A BPR aims to improve efficiency by reducing costs. BPRs may be
expensive and time-consuming to implement. BPRs also can lead to layoffs and disrupt workflow.

Sole proprietorship. Alejandro is a risk-taker who has a high level of independence and control, which means
sole proprietorship would be a good option for business ownership. A sole proprietorship experiences higher
risks because they have unlimited liability. If he did not feel comfortable making all the decisions, desired input
from others, and was not a risk-taker, partnerships, hybrids, or corporations might serve him better.

Sell the company to an employee. If Andrea wants to take a step back from ownership but still wants to be
involved with the restaurant, her best option would be to sell the company to an employee. This is known as an
internal exit, or when the business owner sells the organization to an employee. This will allow Andrea to
remain involved when the restaurant is sold and steadily transition into a new role with the restaurant. Opening
a competing restaurant will not necessarily allow Andrea to take a step back while also staying involved with her
current restaurant. Spending more time away from the restaurant would prevent Andrea from staying involved.
While delegating her tasks and responsibilities to others is a great way for Andrea to take a step back from
ownership, micromanaging the employees or new ownership is not a viable way to stay involved.

Sales commissions. Operating costs are the ongoing, day-to-day expenses of running a business that are not
directly related to production. Operating costs that fluctuate with changes in production (e.g., sales
commissions) are called variable costs. When a company produces more of a product, variable expenses go
up. When a company produces less of a product, variable expenses go down. Operating costs that do not
increase or decrease with changes in production are called fixed costs (or fixed expenses). In other words,
these are the expenses that must be paid no matter what. Examples of fixed expenses include employee

Transparency. Corporate governance refers to the system of rules, policies, and processes by which a
company is controlled and directed. There are many principles a company may use in their corporate
governance models, and one of the most common ones is transparency—the quality of being just as one seems
and being open and truthful. In this scenario, the board of directors is demonstrating transparency by providing
accurate and clear information about its financial performance and conflicts of interest. This scenario does not
demonstrate fairness—treating shareholders, employees, etc. fairly and with equal consideration. This scenario
does not describe accountability—accepting responsibility for actions and decisions, as well as the results of
them. This scenario does not demonstrate risk management—determining all risks and deciding how to best
control them.

Select a SWOT facilitator. A SWOT analysis investigates a business’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
and threats in an organized fashion. This type of analysis is important for businesses because it allows them to
focus on specific areas, while also identifying actions that can help build on strengths, minimize weaknesses,
maximize opportunities, and confront threats. One of the first things businesses should do when conducting a
SWOT analysis is to select a SWOT facilitator. It is often helpful for companies to use an independent facilitator
to free up the company's manager, team leader, or project leader to fully participate and not influence the input
from others. Once a SWOT facilitator is selected, the business can go forth with brainstorming strengths,
consolidating its ideas, identifying its strengths, and summarizing its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and
threats.

Networking with other entrepreneurs. An opportunity is a circumstance that presents itself as a favorable means

Another way entrepreneurs can identify new opportunities is by talking with both vendors and customers.
Rather than focusing solely on their own ideas, entrepreneurs should conduct market research, welcome
customer feedback, and listen to ideas from employees. Opportunities can often present themselves at any
time, but they usually don't happen while doing tasks such as revising operating budgets.

The employee's behaviors and results should be the main focus. When conducting an employee performance
review, managers should evaluate the employee's behaviors and results rather than their traits (attitude,
leadership, motivation, etc.). Behaviors and results can be directly observed, whereas traits can be subjective
and difficult to evaluate on a fair basis. Rather than the manager serving as judge and jury of an employee
during a review, it should be a two-way process where the employee evaluates themselves too. Performance
and compensation should not be discussed together during a performance review. Rather, the review should
focus on development with a conversation about compensation coming at a later date. Managers should give
their employees advanced notice and should schedule the review for a date and time that works well for the
employee.

Inform. Organizations have three major objectives when using promotion to influence customers: to inform, to
persuade, and to remind. Many companies use promotion to communicate important information about their
products. Promotions that inform customers may also educate them on how to use products to their fullest
advantage. For example, food manufacturers often provide customers with useful information, such as recipes
on their websites, to explain the many ways that their products can be used to prepare meals. They may also
provide information about the natural or healthy qualities of their foods. Promotion can be used by companies to
persuade and remind, but neither of these are demonstrated in this example. To socialize is not a use of
promotion by companies.

In addition, good corporate governance helps build trust with investors and gives them a clear idea of a

effective. While it is important to consider yourself and your needs, it is also important to consider the needs of
others, especially in a strategic relationship. Seeking a deal as soon as possible and not asking questions are
not ways in which businesses should look to build strategic relationships. Rather, businesses should be willing

Reduced expenses. When individuals and/or businesses combine, expenses are often reduced. For example,
expenses may be decreased for promotion, office space, supplies, and utilities. Unlimited liability is a
disadvantage of business partnerships. When individuals and/or businesses combine, competition is decreased
or eliminated, which is an advantage. Although partners may bring more capital to the business than sole
proprietors, the amount of capital is still limited, and lenders may still be reluctant to lend large amounts of
money to partnerships.

The date the business opened. A business plan is a company's business model in written form. It serves as a
company’s blueprint for success and shows how the business works now and how it is intended to work in the
future. There are several sections of a typical business plan, including a cover page, executive summary, table
of contents, company description, product(s) offered, and market analysis, to name a few. The date the
business opened is information typically found in the company description section. The company's mission
statement and its founders and their functions are both included in the executive summary of the business
plan—the most important part of a company’s business or marketing plan because it gives an overview of the
entire document, and is often used to determine whether it is worthwhile to read any further. The goods the
business offers is information typically found in the product(s) offered section.

Misconduct. A company can legally dismiss an employee for many reasons, including misconduct, poor
performance, and insubordination. Misconduct can include physical violence or threats against other
employees, discriminatory behavior in the workplace, attendance issues, and unethical behavior. It is illegal for
companies to fire employees based on retaliation, or employees exercising their legal rights (e.g., reporting
discrimination, joining a union, filing a worker's compensation claim). It is illegal for companies to fire employees
based on their age, religion, gender, etc., as it is discriminatory.

Offer a discount after a purchase is made. A rebate is a return of part of the price a customer pays for a good or
service, and it is usually offered by the product's manufacturer. Rebates offer discounts after a purchase is
made, whereas coupons offer discounts at the time of a purchase. Coupons provide customers with immediate
savings, while rebates provide delayed savings. Coupons are typically easier to use than rebates, as customers
simply need to present the coupon at the checkout counter or type in a code online. Rebates often require
customers to submit a form or proof of purchase.

Company structure. There are many factors that influence a business’s buying behavior. Internal factors include
business size and structure, as well as business policies and procedures. For example, a small business
probably does not have a purchasing department. Instead, the owner or manager may be in charge of the entire
buying process. In large corporations, however, there may be dozens of employees whose jobs are specifically
focused on purchasing (professional buyers). B2B marketers take a different approach to each type of
business. The economy, competition, and laws and regulations are all external factors influencing a business’s
buying behavior.

If it needs to fully understand a venture's risks and benefits. A feasibility study is an organized inquiry into the
possible success of a business idea or venture. Feasibility studies are great for businesses that are looking to
fully understand the risks and benefits associated with the proposed ventures. If a business wants to
understand its competitors, it should conduct a competitive analysis—the process of comparing a business’s
income statement with that of its competitors to see how it is doing by industry standards. A SWOT analysis
investigates a business’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in an organized fashion. If a
business wants to study a certain market, it should conduct a market analysis—a systematic study of a specific
market.

Identify problems or issues. Marketers use data to keep an eye out for problems and issues in areas like
customer service, vendors/suppliers, salespeople, and the product itself. For example, marketers want to make
sure customers are receiving expected levels of after-sales service, and they use data to confirm this is the
case. Marketers use data to make budgeting decisions, develop pricing strategies, and make predictions, but
these are not necessarily related to customers and customer service.

Ultimate consumer. A channel of distribution begins with a producer and ends with an ultimate consumer or
industrial user. An ultimate consumer is anyone who personally uses a good or service to satisfy their own
needs or wants. Because Arna gets her teeth cleaned by her dentist, she is one of the dentist’s ultimate
consumers. An industrial user is a business that buys materials, services, or goods that will be used to make
other goods or used in the operation of the company. A producer makes or provides goods and services.
Channels of distribution are the paths, or routes, that goods and services take from the producer to the ultimate
consumer or industrial user.

Clicking email links from an unrecognized email address. When you receive an email from an unrecognized
email address, it is important to proceed with caution. You should not click on the links in the email unless
you’re able to confirm the email is legitimate and the links are safe. If the email seems suspicious and could be
a phishing email, report it to your IT team. Regularly updating the software on your computer and using different
passwords for work and personal accounts are ways to protect from security issues in the workplace. Checking
personal social media accounts on your phone is not necessarily something that could lead to a security issue
in the workplace.

Corporate. A vertical marketing system is where pieces in the distribution channel—producers, wholesalers,
and retailers—work together as a unit to deliver products to final consumers. The three types of vertical
marketing systems are corporate, contractual, and administered. A corporate vertical marketing system
streamlines the process by bringing all of the elements of the distribution channel under the ownership of a
single business. In a contractual vertical marketing system, the pieces of the distribution channel continue to
function as individual entities and enter into contractual relationships with other elements in the distribution
channels. Administered vertical marketing systems do not employ formal contractual obligation nor corporate
ownership of the distribution channel. Rather, one member of the distribution channel has enough power to
control the activities of other members of the distribution channel. Exclusive vertical marketing system is a
fictitious term.

Fixed monthly cost. When leasing a facility, you rent the property for a set term and must renegotiate to
continue using it. Some benefits of leasing a facility include that it has a fixed monthly cost, it gives you the
flexibility to leave the property, and there's an opportunity to receive tax breaks for property expenses. Some
disadvantages of leasing are that you have no control of the property and you are unable to collect passive
income. Benefits of buying a facility include that it gives you control over the property, equity in the property
builds over time, and the asset value appreciates over time.

Pure. With pure risk, there are two possibilities—loss or no loss. Either something bad happens or nothing
happens. Pure risks are considered insurable risks, meaning that businesses are able to take out insurance
policies against them. For example, a business can get auto insurance to protect company vehicles.
Speculative risks are not insurable. Tangible and intangible are descriptors more frequently applied to assets in
risk management rather than types of risks themselves.

They rely heavily on management estimates and inputs. Enterprise risk management (ERM) is an organizationwide strategy to identify, assess, and prepare for potential dangers and hazards that may harm or interfere with
an organization's finances, operations, and objectives. A disadvantage of ERM is that it relies heavily on
management estimates and inputs, which sometimes can be very difficult to accurately predict. ERM identifies
risk that a company has been exposed to in the past, and is thus limited in identifying future risk that a company
is not yet aware of. ERM benefits a business because it leads to less unexpected risks and greater employee
satisfaction, while reducing or even eliminating redundant processes.

Earthquakes. Location risks are any type of hazard risks businesses may encounter due to their location. For
example, in the United States, companies based in the west coast are more susceptible to earthquakes,
whereas companies near the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific Coast are more susceptible to hurricanes. Fires are
an example of building risks. Employee injuries are an example of human risks. Power outages are an example
of technology risks.

is the division of a market on the basis of where customers are located. Behavioral segmentation is the division
of a market on the basis of customers' responses to a product.

Total costs and total revenue are equal. A breakeven analysis refers to the process of determining the level at
which revenues equal total costs. A breakeven analysis is used to determine the amount of revenue needed to
cover total costs. Total costs being higher than total revenue, total revenue being higher than total costs, or total
revenue and total costs being inversely proportional do not represent a breakeven analysis.

Be genuine. To be most effective, recognition must be genuine. If you really believe in the value of the person’s

logo, Camilla is likely to pick up on his true feelings. In this situation De’Vondre’s recognition was personalized

purchases and at reasonable prices. Purchasing systems do not help businesses recruit employees, promote
products, or increase social media engagement.
